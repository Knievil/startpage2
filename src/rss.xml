Another<a href="https://truthout.org/articles/legislative-attacks-on-drag-performances-lead-to-cancellation-of-pride-events/"> uses obscenity laws to potentially target drag events</a>, which has already led to pride parades being cancelled. Yet<a href="https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/trans-patients-being-dropped-as-florida"> another bill</a> bans gender affirming care for trans youth and bans nurse practitioners &#8212; the providers of nearly 80% of gender-affirming care &#8212; from treating trans adults. The most troubling bill, though, is a <a href="https://legiscan.com/FL/text/H1521/2023">ban on transgender people in bathrooms</a> that comes with criminal charges and jail sentences. The wording of the ban raises serious concerns that many transgender adults are in imminent danger of arrest once the law comes into effect.</p><p><a href="https://legiscan.com/FL/text/H1521/2023">House Bill 1521</a> will effectively give second-class citizen status to transgender people in Florida. The wording of the bill states that if a cisgender person is in the bathroom with a transgender person, an employee can tell the transgender person to leave. Should the transgender person not leave immediately for any reason, they will be charged with criminal trespass, which can carry sentences of up to <a href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;URL=0800-0899/0810/Sections/0810.08.html">1 year in jail</a> - likely a jail of the wrong gender identity, which will put trans people in immense danger of sexual assault. </p><p>While the provisions do not ban all bathroom usage, they cast a wide net over an alarming number of locations that would fall under definitions of &#8220;public&#8221; in the bill. This includes all buildings owned or leased by any governmental entity, educational institutions spanning from elementary schools to private colleges and universities, numerous hospitals owned by universities, many sports arenas, convention centers, city parks, beaches, airports, and more.</p><p>You can see the provisions on public bathrooms here:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddc68da8-a7e1-42f9-9d25-4e5420fc9706_1374x372.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddc68da8-a7e1-42f9-9d25-4e5420fc9706_1374x372.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddc68da8-a7e1-42f9-9d25-4e5420fc9706_1374x372.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddc68da8-a7e1-42f9-9d25-4e5420fc9706_1374x372.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddc68da8-a7e1-42f9-9d25-4e5420fc9706_1374x372.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddc68da8-a7e1-42f9-9d25-4e5420fc9706_1374x372.png" width="1374" height="372" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ddc68da8-a7e1-42f9-9d25-4e5420fc9706_1374x372.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:372,&quot;width&quot;:1374,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddc68da8-a7e1-42f9-9d25-4e5420fc9706_1374x372.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddc68da8-a7e1-42f9-9d25-4e5420fc9706_1374x372.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddc68da8-a7e1-42f9-9d25-4e5420fc9706_1374x372.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddc68da8-a7e1-42f9-9d25-4e5420fc9706_1374x372.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Prohibition on bathroom usage with criminal trespass penalties.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Many transgender people erroneously believe they will be exempt from this law due to updated gender markers and birth certificate changes. The Florida bathroom ban specifically defines sex in a way that does not utilize legal sex or birth certificate sex. Instead, it states that sex is determined by this law as &#8220;indicated by the person&#8217;s sex chromosomes, naturally occurring sex hormones, and internal and external genitalia present at birth.&#8221; It then defines male and female based on reproductive capacity. </p><p>As a result, enforcement might involve criminal investigations into transgender people&#8217;s sex based off of profiling alone. Transgender people may be forced to undergo genitalia exams, DNA testing, and historical investigations if they are accused of violating the bathroom ban. </p><p>See the definitions used for sex in this law here:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank"

Worse, many transgender people will risk arrest by going into the bathroom that the state law requires trans people to enter. Transgender people who are androgenous or pass as their gender identity will likely be challenged in the bathroom of their birth sex. Those trans people will then be forced to undergo the same investigation into their gender. In essence, it amounts to a ban on bathrooms for transgender people entirely.</p><p>Due to the way that laws go into effect in Florida, the bathroom ban will go into effect on July 1st - the day after Pride Month. </p><p>The bathroom bill would be bad enough, but DeSantis signed three other anti-trans bills into law as well. One of the most problematic of those bills is a ban on most gender affirming care for transgender adults. <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2023/254/BillText/er/PDF">Senate Bill 254</a> bans gender affirming care for trans youth and bans nurse practitioners from providing gender affirming care to trans adults. SPEKTRUM Health, a provider in Florida, has indicated in an exclusive interview with Erin In The Morning that up to 80% of all gender care in the state is provided by nurse practitioners - a statistic in line with <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-southeastern-pennsylvania/patients/transgender-health-care/gender-affirming-care-faq">information provided by Planned Parenthood</a>.</p><p>Already, people are losing access to medication in Florida and Lana Dunn of SPEKTRUM Health has stated that transgender people are having appointments cancelled by medical organizations around the state. This is because unlike the bathroom ban, which goes into effect July 1st, SB254 has an immediate effective date. Due to penalties provided by SB254, many medical providers have determined they can no longer provide that care.</p><p>Medical appointments are not the only thing being cancelled - a third law signed by DeSantis is an obscenity law that will likely be utilized to go after pride parades and drag. <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2023/1438/BillText/er/PDF">Senate Bill 1438</a> has an immediate effective date and has already led to cancellations of pride events, including the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/florida-gay-pride-parade-canceled-b0db01bf37576492637a5737f788f967">Treasure Coast Pride Parade</a>. </p><p>The final law signed by DeSantis was <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/612715-gov-desantis-approves-restricting-pronoun-use-in-schools-expanding-book-challenge-powers/">House Bill 1069</a>, a Don&#8217;t Say Gay expansion, attacks trans and queer people in new ways. Transgender people will not be able to share updated pronouns with their classmates and students. It will also allow for challenging of books in libraries that have LGBTQ+ topics and will expand existing Don&#8217;t Say Gay provisions to the 12th grade. This will go into effect on July 1st.</p><p>The effective dates of these laws are as follows:</p><ul><li><p><strong><a href="https://legiscan.com/FL/text/H1521/2023">HB1521</a> - </strong>Bathroom Ban - Effective July 1, 2023</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2023/1069/BillText/er/PDF">HB1069</a> - </strong>Don&#8217;t Say Gay Expansion - Effective July 1, 2023</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2023/254/BillText/er/PDF">SB254</a> - </strong>Trans Youth Ban, Adult 80% Care Ban - Effective Immediately</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2023/1438/BillText/er/PDF">SB1438</a> - </strong>Obscenity Law Targeting Drag - Effective Immediately</p></li></ul><p>Collectively, these laws represent a direct affront to the liberties of transgender and queer Floridians, marking the most radical assortment of laws targeting transgender people ever ratified by any state. The bathroom ban, in particular, if permitted to take full effect, may serve as an ominous blueprint for other states that have exhibited an interest in passing anti-transgender legislation this year. Given the escalating, heated rhetoric and increasingly draconian laws that typically gain traction across the nation after Florida's endorsement&#8212;a pattern we have observed consistently over recent years&#8212;it's plausible that such a bathroom ban will emerge as a legislative template in 2024. </p><p>As it stands, transgender Floridians are unwittingly stepping into a perilous landscape, and if the law is vigorously enforced, the impending surge of arrests will likely take everyone aback in the coming months.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.erininthemorning.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Please support my independent reporting and activism on transgender legislation by subscribing.

They're doing this by attaching an abortion ban to the bill. Senators Machaela Cavanaugh and Megan Hunt have led a three-month filibuster against <a href="https://legiscan.com/NE/bill/LB574/2023">LB574</a>, effectively stalling the Nebraska legislature so that no bills can pass.</p><p>Now, Republican Senator Ben Hansen, sensing a way to push the bill through, is <a href="https://nebraskalegislature.gov/FloorDocs/108/PDF/AM/AM1658.pdf">trying to amend</a> the bill to not only ban abortions after 10 weeks but also give authority to the state&#8217;s Chief Medical Officer, a Republican appointee, to set all rules on care for transgender youth. While some may label this as a compromise, it feels like a more radical turn. It underlines the unsettling truth that the battles over gender-affirming care and abortion rights are not separate, but rather two faces of the same coin, driven by the same factions, using the same justifications to limit access to vital care.</p><p>The proposed amendment introduces two significant alterations to the current bill, which currently seeks to ban all gender-affirming care for transgender youth under 19 years. </p><p>Firstly, the amendment would shift the explicitly stated ban away from hormone therapy and puberty blockers, focusing exclusively on surgeries. This may appear as a concession, potentially allowing trans youth to access some forms of care.</p><p>However, a second provision has set off alarm bells for those opposing the bill. This provision would delegate full authority to Nebraska's Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Timothy Tesmer, to establish all regulations regarding gender-affirming care for trans youth, making it obligatory for his office to do so.

Though this may seem like a compromise, it is easy to envision a world where the Republican party manages to get a bill through while selling it as a compromise when in reality, the end result for trans youth may be a more severe set of restrictions on gender affirming care than even the original bill had. This fear was confirmed when Republican Senator Tom Briese <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2023/05/10/final-say-on-nebraska-gender-care-legislation-would-be-delegated-to-executive-appointee-and-dhhs/">stated</a> that &#8220;it is possible that some of the criteria that will be put in place may be more stringent than some would hope for.&#8221;</p><p>The second addition in this amendment is a ban on abortion care after 10 weeks. Although the bill specifically states that the ban would be on abortions after 12 weeks, it counts the gestational age from the last missed period rather than from fertilization. The ban also does not have any exceptions for fetal abnormalities, even for severe abnormalities that would threaten viability. This comes after a 6 week abortion ban failed to pass earlier in the year.</p><p>Few observers of anti-trans legislation are shocked by the Republican strategy of bundling an anti-abortion bill with an anti-trans bill, seeking passage with a single vote. Groups like the Alliance Defending Freedom have been instrumental in crafting, lobbying, and advocating for these bills, with their members even contributing to the original drafts, as revealed by a <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2023/03/anti-trans-transgender-health-care-ban-legislation-bill-minors-children-lgbtq/">leaked email collection</a> published earlier this year. These very organizations are also responsible for the lawsuit that led to the ban on the abortion drug mifepristone in Texas.</p><p>The tactics employed to target transgender care and abortion care bear striking resemblances. The shrinking gestational age limits in abortion bans parallel the rising age restrictions for gender-affirming care. Targeted restrictions on abortion providers (TRAP Laws), such as mandatory waiting periods and burdensome medical guidelines, also emerge in this bill, this time aimed at gender-affirming care. The struggle for bodily autonomy spans across gender-affirming care, abortion care, reproductive healthcare, and all other areas where assaults on bodily autonomy reinforce patriarchal power structures.</p><p>Last year, a Republican Lawmaker in Idaho <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2022/03/11/idaho-transgender-medical-treatment-bill/">made the point explicitly</a>. State representative Elizabeth Coleman stated of a gender affirming care ban there, &#8220;I see this conversation as an extension of the pro-life argument. We are not talking about the life of the child, but we are talking about the potential to give life to another generation.&#8221;</p><p>In mere hours, LB574 will undergo a debate. Should the amendment pass, it is likely that the bill will need to go back to a second reading before it progresses to third reading and full passage. Should the plan to amend the bill fail, it may either be immediately pushed for passage or <a href="https://www.keloland.com/news/local-news/nebraska-lawmakers-debate-transgender-abortion/">could be held</a> for the remainder of the year. Meanwhile, Democrats may continue to filibuster on the bill and could break out new attempts to slow the debate so that the legislature adjourns before the bill can be passed.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.erininthemorning.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Please support my independent reporting and activism on transgender legislation by subscribing.

Meanwhile, the board of medicine proceeded to <a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2022/11/15/florida-bans-gender-affirming-care-trans-youth/8317367001/">ban gender affirming care for transgender youth</a>. To do this, they relied on a newly created <a href="https://ahca.myflorida.com/content/download/4869/file/AHCA_GAPMS_June_2022_Report.pdf">&#8220;Standards of Care&#8221;</a> for the treatment of gender dysphoria that was rife with errors and omissions. Now, new court filings show that the Florida Surgeon General&#8217;s Office and the Agency for Health Care Administration purposefully manipulated this research to justify banning gender affirming care, including a flow chart produced before the &#8220;research&#8221; was commissioned with the explicit end goal of &#8220;care effectively banned.&#8221; Worse, they utilized a consultant from a religious conversion therapy organization to do so.</p><p>The newly minted Florida &#8220;Generally Accepted Professional Medical Standards Determination on the Treatment of Gender Dysphoria&#8221; <a href="https://ahca.myflorida.com/content/download/4869/file/AHCA_GAPMS_June_2022_Report.pdf">were released</a> in June 2022, and within a month, Florida&#8217;s Agency for Health Care Administration <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/11/florida-finalizes-ban-medicaid-transgender-treatments-00051259">banned gender affirming care coverage</a>. Florida&#8217;s board of medicine relied on it heavily in <a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/special-reports/features/101624">their ban on gender affirming care</a> for transgender youth as well. The document, which claims that &#8220;gender affirming care&#8221; is experimental and does not meet medical guidelines, was immediately slammed by scientific and medical organizations and experts. </p><p>A <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/lgbtqi/research/gender-affirming-care/florida%20report%20final%20july%208%202022%20accessible_443048_284_55174_v3.pdf">Yale Review</a> scathingly criticized the report, stating, &#8220;We are alarmed that Florida&#8217;s health care agency has adopted a purportedly scientific report that so blatantly violates the basic tenets of scientific inquiry&#8230; So repeated and fundamental are the errors in the June 2 Report that it seems clear that the report is not a serious scientific analysis but, rather, a document crafted to serve a political agenda.&#8221;</p><p>Now, we have direct evidence that this was the case. In a lawsuit aiming to reverse Florida's Medicaid ban, the discovery process <a href="https://transgender.agency/dvw/DOC%20182-36%20PL%20296.pdf">unearthed documents</a> from the Florida Surgeon General&#8217;s Office.

Emails show that Jason Weida of Florida&#8217;s AHCA was put in touch with Dr. Andre Van Mol, a religious fundamentalist and conversion therapy supporter who chairs the adolescent sexuality committee of the American College of Pediatricians.</p><p>You can see <a href="https://transgender.agency/dvw/DOC%20182-11%20PL%20279.pdf">this email</a>, unearthed by anti-LGBTQ+ extremism researcher<a href="https://genderanalysis.net/2023/05/andres-opinion-florida-medicaid-agency-paid-thousands-to-a-hate-group-leader-to-help-ghostwrite-their-anti-trans-policy-he-copied-nearly-all-of-his-sources-from-the-hate-g/"> Zinnia Jones</a> from discovery documents in Florida:</p><blockquote><p>Dear Jason and Trey,</p><p>Due to two unforeseen family crises, I must decline serving as a consultant for the State of FL at this time. My well-credentialed and equally expert in GD colleague, Dr. Andre Van Mol, has agreed to take my place so I am introducing him to you in this email.</p><p>Dr. Van Mol is a practicing Family Medicine physician in CA. In addition to being published on matters of medical ethics and childhood GD, he is Chair of the Adolescent Sexuality Committee of the American College of Pediatricians and a spokesperson for the Christian Medical and Dental Associations. He will be an outstanding consultant for your team in terms of provision of and analysis of studies. He has catalogued the literature as long as I have.</p></blockquote><p>Dr. Van Mol would go on to promote documents created by the ACP in order to get them enshrined into Florida&#8217;s medical literature. One such document was developed in January 2023 and was discovered due to a massive leak of documents by the organization. This document is <a href="https://genderanalysis.net/2023/05/andres-opinion-florida-medicaid-agency-paid-thousands-to-a-hate-group-leader-to-help-ghostwrite-their-anti-trans-policy-he-copied-nearly-all-of-his-sources-from-the-hate-g/">quoted by Jones</a> as being a &#8220;129-page file of references and sources for anti-trans arguments, attributed to Andre Van Mol and dated January 2, 2022&#8221; - you can find a full link to the first version of the document in Jones&#8217; research. The slightly updated document was directly sent to the AHCA with a few additions in order to help develop their standards of care with the explicit goal to ban trans care <a href="https://transgender.agency/files/dekker-v-weida/183-32.pdf">and can be found in the court filings.</a> </p><p>This document houses much of the now-known-to-be deliberately distorted research that Yale scientists denounced as flagrantly unscientific. For example, Yale researchers highlighted how the Florida Standards of Care recommend that trans youth should not receive any medical care, asserting that psychotherapy alone, termed "watchful waiting" by the Florida standards, is adequate for trans youth. To validate this, the standards lean heavily on a criticisms from a single doctor, Dr. James Cantor, while overlooking studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of gender-affirming care in reducing suicides. All justifications for this approach, including the dependence on Cantor, can be traced back to the documents from the American College of Pediatricians (ACP) that Dr. Van Mol utilized and passed on to the Florida Agency for Healthcare Administration (AHCA).</p><p>Dr. Van Mol himself is a noted proponent of &#8220;reparative therapy&#8221; and &#8220;sexual orientation change efforts.&#8221; He has published multiple articles in favor of conversion therapy, including <a href="https://cmda.org/evidence-opposing-therapy-bans/">an article</a> that claims that &#8220;homosexuality can be changeable&#8221; and that there is &#8220;no evidence of harm&#8221; in sexual orientation conversion therapy, <a href="https://www.hrc.org/resources/the-lies-and-dangers-of-reparative-therapy?utm_medium=ads&amp;utm_source=GoogleSearch&amp;utm_content=ConversionTherapy-General&amp;utm_campaign=GoogleGrant&amp;utm_source=GS&amp;utm_medium=AD&amp;utm_campaign=BPI-HRC-Grant&amp;utm_content=627545435750&amp;utm_term=conversion%20therapy&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwsIejBhDOARIsANYqkD2tdjt3tsXQLn6CvDNQ_oD59IKGHDz1R8Pgu2EyiKZMZEzqbUyfJigaAo0_EALw_wcB">despite research</a> showing that conversion therapy raises suicide rates by as much as 800%. In a recent video discussing conversion therapy, Dr. Van Mol advocates for conversion therapy and asks for pastors supporting LGBTQ+ people to repent.</p><div id="youtube2-6BAvb_tFUUs" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;6BAvb_tFUUs&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:&quot;1205&quot;,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6BAvb_tFUUs?start=1205&amp;rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>The Florida Agency for Healthcare Administration and the Florida Surgeon General are now incontrovertibly implicated in distorting research to further their objective of banning gender-affirming care. The manipulated research was facilitated using materials generated by a Christian fundamentalist conversion therapy group, the American College of Pediatricians, and a consultant advocating for sexual conversion therapy, Dr. Van Mol, with the end goal of banning care explicitly spelled out.</p><p>The newly established "standards of care" in Florida have been lambasted for flawed interpretations of scientific papers, selective omission of critical facts, and the incorporation of unsubstantiated pseudoscience reviews by Yale researchers. Such practices, in an academic context, would warrant severe sanctions and spell the end of careers for those involved. It amounts to academic misconduct on a scale rarely seen, particularly given the subsequent use of this research to deny care to tens of thousands of Floridians.</p><p>The manipulated research has begun to infiltrate other scholarly arenas. A recent <a href="https://www.bmj.com/company/newsroom/gender-dysphoria-in-young-people-is-rising-and-so-is-professional-disagreement/">British Medical Journal article</a>, "Gender dysphoria in young people is rising&#8212;and so is professional disagreement," cited the Florida study to question the appropriateness of gender-affirming care as the standard medical approach to gender dysphoria. Subsequently, an expert in the case of Dekker v Weida, which contests the ban on gender-affirming care, <a href="https://ahca.myflorida.com/content/download/21423/file/Dekker_v_Weida_Kaliebe_Rebuttal_Report.pdf">referenced the BMJ's article</a> to back the ban. Ironically, that very article partly relies on Florida's manipulated research!</p><p>It reveals a striking lack of integrity for those involved in Florida to question the scientific validity of the care standards for transgender individuals, given that the state's research findings were deliberately tampered with to endorse banning such care. The court will assess these arguments when deciding whether to overturn the rule prohibiting Medicaid coverage of gender-affirming care in the months ahead. Documents uncovered during the discovery process will be instrumental in shaping the final judicial decision.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.erininthemorning.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Please support my independent reporting and activism on transgender legislation by subscribing.

The legislation, <a href="https://legiscan.com/FL/text/S0254/id/2799959">SB254</a>, has been passed and will go into effect when signed by Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida. It has caught the eye of LGBTQ+ media primarily due to its impact on transgender youth as outlined in the bill's provisions: it outright bans gender affirming care for this demographic, and may also introduce complexities in custody scenarios where parents disagree on affirmation.</p><p>While the majority of discourse around SB254 focuses on its repercussions for transgender youth, a provision that has received less attention within the bill is already spelling disaster for transgender adult care. The legislation bars all nurse practitioners from offering gender affirming care and imposes additional restrictions on informed consent care for transgender adults. Considering that nurse practitioners provide the majority of gender affirming care, this could drastically reduce the number of providers, lowering it to a level that is unsustainable for Florida's transgender patient population.</p><p>In an exclusive conversation with Lana Dunn from SPEKTRUM Health, the clinic has indicated that it is getting a near constant influx of phone calls from patients whose appointments are being cancelled. Reasons for cancellation include that the care is too difficult to provide now given new liabilities introduced by this law and restrictions on perscribers. While SPEKTRUM is still providing care, Dunn indicates that they are in an uncomfortable limbo:</p><p>&#8220;We have thousands of patients at SPEKTRUM, all of whom are eagerly trying to get their appointments in before the law goes into effect and we simply have no way to keep up with the demand. Our team has been working feverishly throughout all of this to meet the demand,&#8221; Dunn says.</p><p>When asked about organizations that are ceasing care, she even indicated that once the law takes effect, SPEKTRUM may have to cease care: &#8220;Here at SPEKTRUM we are operating at the highest capacity possible until such a time as the law goes into effect at which point we will have no choice but to cease providing gender affirming care.&#8221;</p><p>The provisions causing trouble for organizations are seen here:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link

SPEKTRUM has confirmed that at least 80% of all gender affirming care is provided by nurse practitioners in the state. This matches with data from my <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1DxyOTw8dI8n96BHFF2JVUMK7bXsRKtzA&amp;hl=en_US&amp;ll=0%2C0&amp;z=3">informed consent hormone therapy map</a> - very few of the locations go to MDs/DOs. Planned Parenthood, which provides a huge amount of the care, primarily uses nurse practitioners to administer that care - all of my personal care has been handled by nurse practitioners, as seen from <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-southeastern-pennsylvania/patients/transgender-health-care/gender-affirming-care-faq">Planned Parenthood&#8217;s FAQ</a> on gender affirming care:</p><blockquote><p>Most gender-affirming hormone care is provided at PPSP by advanced practice providers (physician assistants, certified nurse midwives, and nurse practitioners) in our health centers or over telemedicine.</p></blockquote><p>The alarming aspects of the new legislation are not limited to the provisions that prevent nurse practitioners from providing gender affirming care. The law also targets this care through various other channels. For example, one provision grants the board of medicine authority to adopt emergency rules for implementing the new law. The board has already demonstrated its willingness to overstep existing law by introducing rules - earlier this year, it <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2023-03-16/floridas-board-of-medicine-bans-gender-affirming-care-for-minors-does-the-science-back-that-up#:~:text=Save%20Comment-,Florida's%20Board%20of%20Medicine%20Bans%20Gender%2DAffirming%20Care%20for%20Minors,the%20Science%20Back%20That%20Up%3F&amp;text=THURSDAY%2C%20March%2016%2C%202023%20(,affirming%20care%20for%20transgender%20minors.">imposed a ban</a> on gender affirming care for transgender youth, despite lacking legislative instruction to do so. This ban is <a href="https://winknews.com/2023/03/24/florida-transgender-treatment-rules-draw-court-challenge/">currently under judicial review</a>.</p><p>In a similar vein, the attorney general of Missouri recently<a href="https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/trans-adults-officially-being-detransitioned"> issued a series of burdensome guidelines</a> that essentially obstruct gender affirming care for most transgender adults with a complex web of rules, making the care nearly impossible to legally provide. This decision, however, has <a href="https://www.kcur.org/politics-elections-and-government/2023-05-04/missouri-transgender-gender-affirming-care-attorney-general">recently been blocked in court</a> for at least two months. The provision in Florida's law, which grants rule-making authority to the board of medicine, could potentially be wielded in a similar manner to further restrict care.</p><p>The legislation also requires misinformation in informed consent forms that must be handed to and signed by every patient. Though the final version of the form is not available, earlier versions have statements erroneously claiming that the care does not conform to generally accepted medical practices. Over <a href="https://transhealthproject.org/resources/medical-organization-statements/">29 major medical organizations</a> maintain gender affirming care as the standard of care for trans people. </p><p>See the <a href="https://genderanalysis.net/2022/11/tracking-organized-anti-trans-submissions-to-the-florida-board-of-medicine-october-28-meeting-which-passed-a-ban-on-medical-transition-for-trans-youth/">proposed form from 2022</a> when the issue was first discussed by the Florida Department of Health here, documented by Zinnia Jones:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d60aeb8-44e9-4274-a4d9-f64313e95a7d_1530x1576.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d60aeb8-44e9-4274-a4d9-f64313e95a7d_1530x1576.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d60aeb8-44e9-4274-a4d9-f64313e95a7d_1530x1576.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d60aeb8-44e9-4274-a4d9-f64313e95a7d_1530x1576.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d60aeb8-44e9-4274-a4d9-f64313e95a7d_1530x1576.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d60aeb8-44e9-4274-a4d9-f64313e95a7d_1530x1576.png" width="1456" height="1500" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5d60aeb8-44e9-4274-a4d9-f64313e95a7d_1530x1576.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1500,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d60aeb8-44e9-4274-a4d9-f64313e95a7d_1530x1576.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d60aeb8-44e9-4274-a4d9-f64313e95a7d_1530x1576.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d60aeb8-44e9-4274-a4d9-f64313e95a7d_1530x1576.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d60aeb8-44e9-4274-a4d9-f64313e95a7d_1530x1576.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Proposed informed consent form for trans adults from 2022.</figcaption></figure></div><p>It remains to be seen how medical organizations and transgender adults will react to the bill if it is signed into law.

When combined with a recent transgender bathroom ban, Florida is quickly emerging as the state most hostile to transgender people in the United States.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.erininthemorning.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Please support my independent reporting and activism on transgender legislation by subscribing.

Despite holding supermajorities in numerous instances, they have frequently silenced oppositional voices. Notably, in Oklahoma, GOP members censured <a href="https://19thnews.org/2023/03/oklahoma-censures-nonbinary-lawmaker-mauree-turner/">Representative Mauree Turner</a>, a Black, nonbinary representative. In Kentucky, an attempt was made to <a href="https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/mics-off-6-minutes-notice-anti-trans">hold a hearing</a> without any Democratic representatives. This was announced during a lunch break when microphones were turned off. A recent <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/zooey-zephyr-and-the-illiberal-decorum-of-montanas-christian-right">incident in Montana</a> saw transgender Rep. Zooey Zephyr ejected from the house floor and silenced simply for speaking to the harm these bills cause, preventing her from commenting on anti-trans bills. Today, in Missouri, the GOP restricted Democrats to 15 minutes of debate against a bill prohibiting gender-affirming care for trans youth. During the vote, gay Republican Rep. Chris Sander was denied the opportunity to speak against the bill despite signaling his intent, keeping his hand raised for the entirety of the vote.</p><p>The bill itself, <a href="https://www.senate.mo.gov/23info/BTS_Web/Bill.aspx?SessionType=R&amp;BillID=44407">SB49</a>, bans gender affirming care for transgender youth. Though it grandfathers youth already receiving treatment in, there will be many trans youth on waitlists who will be entirely shut out. It also bans Medicaid coverage for transgender adults and surgery for transgender incarcerated individuals. All of these provisions are separate from the ongoing attempt by Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey&#8217;s <a href="https://ago.mo.gov/home/news/2023/04/13/missouri-attorney-general-andrew-bailey-promulgates-emergency-regulation-targeting-gender-transition-procedures-for-minors">decision to limit</a> most care for transgender adults, banning many of them from transitioning - that decision is <a href="https://account.kansascity.com/paywall/stop?resume=275071706#:~:text=Missouri%20transgender%20care%20restrictions%20blocked%20for%20two%20months%20after%20court%20hearing%20delayed&amp;text=Missouri%20Attorney%20General%20Andrew%20Bailey's,the%20case%20until%20late%20July.">currently blocked in court</a> awaiting a final decision.</p><p>In a scene eerily familiar to many people who have paid attention to floor debates over anti-trans legislation, Missouri House Speaker, Rep. Dean Plocher, enacted a motion that restricted Democrats to a meager 15 minutes of total discourse on the bill. This appeared to be a calculated move to expedite the bill's passage with minimal opposition. House Minority Leader, Representative Crystal Quade, used some of her time to denounce this tactic, arguing it silenced representatives' speech and, in effect, muffled the voice of the citizenry they represent. This contention closely mirrors a recent incident in Montana involving Rep. Zooey Zephyr, who faced silencing and exile when the house speaker there denied her the right to speak.</p><p>That comparison would quickly grow stronger as a Republican, Representative Chris Sander, raised his own hand to speak. Local reporter Emily Manley reported that he <a href="https://twitter.com/EmilyManleyTV/status/1656311822402695168?s=20">was never called on</a> despite continually keeping his hand raised. Because Republicans have a choice as to whether they acknowledge their own party member, they opted to not do so. </p><p>You can see Rep. Quade&#8217;s initial criticism of the GOP&#8217;s silencing tactics and Rep. Sander&#8217;s hand raised in this video:</p><div id="youtube2-2OOVaoVKdJU" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;2OOVaoVKdJU&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2OOVaoVKdJU?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.erininthemorning.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Please support my independent reporting and activism on transgender legislation by subscribing.

Sander has come under fire from his own party for his stance on LGBTQ+ issues. Earlier in the year, the Jackson County Republican Party <a href="https://www.advocate.com/politics/marriage-equality-censure-gay-republican">considered censuring him</a> for his stance on LGBTQ+ issues after he stated that marriage is between &#8220;two individuals&#8221; rather than &#8220;a man and a woman.&#8221; After the threat to censure him gained national attention, they dropped their threat. <a href="https://www.advocate.com/politics/marriage-equality-censure-gay-republican">The Advocate</a> reports that he could still be censured in the future over this issue.</p><p>After the hearing was over, Rep Sander stood up with Democrats in a press conference to discuss what had occurred. In this conference, he stated, &#8220;I&#8217;m not questioning being gay. I&#8217;m questioning being a Republican&#8221; in response to his lack of recognition.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/EmilyManleyTV/status/1656345235360829441?s=20"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ce5e797-253f-45e2-a079-e168cab1a453_582x592.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ce5e797-253f-45e2-a079-e168cab1a453_582x592.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ce5e797-253f-45e2-a079-e168cab1a453_582x592.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ce5e797-253f-45e2-a079-e168cab1a453_582x592.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ce5e797-253f-45e2-a079-e168cab1a453_582x592.png" width="582" height="592" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1ce5e797-253f-45e2-a079-e168cab1a453_582x592.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:592,&quot;width&quot;:582,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:558365,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/EmilyManleyTV/status/1656345235360829441?s=20&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ce5e797-253f-45e2-a079-e168cab1a453_582x592.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ce5e797-253f-45e2-a079-e168cab1a453_582x592.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ce5e797-253f-45e2-a079-e168cab1a453_582x592.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ce5e797-253f-45e2-a079-e168cab1a453_582x592.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The Democrats who were able to speak with the exceedingly short amount of time slammed the bill. Representative Doug Clemens stood to talk about the affect this bill would have on a trans family member, stating, &#8220;This is family. This is my brothers child&#8230; I can&#8217;t allow this body to take the rights away from someone being themselves.&#8221;</p><p>Representative Barbara Pfifer stood and likewise spoke about her own trans family member, &#8220;Anytime you start persecuting one group of people, horror follows.&#8221;</p><p>Representative Ian Mackey, a gay Democrat, spoke on the bill and expressed disgust on how colleagues continued to &#8220;ask [him] in the halls &#8220;how are you doing&#8221; like it is just another Wednesday morning,&#8221; and how they were surprised when he stated that he wasn&#8217;t doing great due to bills like these.</p><p>Republicans ultimately passed this bill as well as a sports ban for trans people. Both bills will head to the Governor&#8217;s desk. The entire time, Rep. Sanders was not allowed to speak and Democrats were given tiny allotments that stifled all debate. Constituents who elected their representatives to speak on the important bills were not allowed to have their voices heard. Republicans seem to be leaning into doing this in state legislatures across the United States. Although they claim to be champions of free speech, their actions indicate otherwise.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.erininthemorning.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Please support my independent reporting and activism on transgender legislation by subscribing.

Their counterattack has finally arrived. In recent months, lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Department of Justice, National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR), Human Rights Campaign (HRC), Lambda Legal, and several other organizations have contested laws banning gender-affirming care for transgender youth in states nationwide. Success stories are emerging, as seen in Missouri, where a <a href="https://account.kansascity.com/paywall/stop?resume=275071706">temporary restraining order</a> has blocked the ban. With seven states facing lawsuits challenging such bans added in the last few months, the total number of states being sued over gender-affirming care prohibitions now stands at nine.</p><p>Many of these lawsuits are spearheaded by the ACLU, a prominent force in the fight against gender-affirming care bans. In seven out of nine states facing legal action, the ACLU serves as a primary organization representing the plaintiffs. Florida and Alabama stand as the exceptions, with Southern Legal Counsel, GLBTQ Legal Advocates &amp; Defenders, the Justice Department, and the National Center for Lesbian Rights leading the challenges there. The NCLR and other organizations have also been active and serve as co-leads in states like Kentucky. The ACLU has played a significant role in opposing these discriminatory laws this year. </p><p>Earlier, the organization's Deputy Director of Transgender Justice, Chase Strangio, <a href="https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/tennessee-will-not-be-able-to-defend">delivered a powerful testimony</a> against an anti-trans bill in Tennessee. In his testimony, he confidently asserted, "Tennessee will not be able to defend these laws."</p><p>See his testimony here:</p><div id="youtube2-sWX9laUI8nk" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;sWX9laUI8nk&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sWX9laUI8nk?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.erininthemorning.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Please support my independent reporting and activism on transgender legislation by subscribing.

In a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/lgbtq-advocates-sue-tennessee-to-block-dangerous-transgender-healthcare-ban">press release</a> from the ACLU, the girl, whose name is not shared, stated, </p><blockquote><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t even want to think about having to go back to the dark place I was in before I was able to come out and access the care that my doctors have prescribed for me. I want this law to be struck down so that I can continue to receive the care I need, in conversation with my parents and my doctors, and have the freedom to live my life and do the things I enjoy.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>The ACLU is attempting to ensure that the law meets that fate.</p><p>Today, Montana became the latest state to <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/montana-health-care-providers-and-families-challenge-law-banning-gender-affirming-care-for-transgender-youth">face a lawsuit</a> over its gender-affirming care ban. Montana has emerged as a hotspot for some of the harshest anti-trans laws and actions this year. With a <a href="https://leg.mt.gov/bills/2023/billhtml/SB0099.htm">gender-affirming care ban</a>, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/montana-lawmakers-send-drag-story-hour-ban-governor-rcna82859">drag ban</a>, prohibition of <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/narrow-legal-definition-of-sex-in-montana-bill-would-jeopardize-protections-for-trans-people">gender markers on driver's licenses</a> combined with a <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/narrow-legal-definition-of-sex-in-montana-bill-would-jeopardize-protections-for-trans-people">rigid definition of sex</a> that excludes transgender individuals, and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/05/09/some-gop-dominated-statehouses-black-trans-lawmakers-punished/">expulsion of the state's first trans woman representative </a>from the House floor, Montana has become a focal point for legal observers. The lawsuit is supported by prominent organizations, including ACLU Montana, Lambda Legal, and Perkins Coie, who are all committed to combating anti-trans measures in the state.</p><p>Jessica van Garderen, mother of a trans daughter in Montana and a plaintiff in the lawsuit, was <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/montana-health-care-providers-and-families-challenge-law-banning-gender-affirming-care-for-transgender-youth">quoted in a joint statement</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;It is mentally and physically painful to feel like you are trapped in the wrong body. Going through puberty for the wrong sex is like having your body betray you on a daily basis. The only treatment we have found to be effective and give our daughter hope again is hormone therapy. The difference we have experienced is night and day and there is no going back. Taking away this crucial medical care is inhumane and a violation of our rights. We will fight this law for our daughter and every other family whose rights are being trampled.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Earlier this year, Montana<a href="https://www.mtpr.org/montana-news/2023-01-19/gianforte-requests-2-6-million-to-defend-laws-against-court-challenges"> increased their budget by $2.6 million</a> to account for court challenges to clearly unconstitutional legislation.</p><p>There is ample reason to believe these lawsuits will succeed. So far, legal challenges against gender-affirming care bans and anti-trans policies have been effective. Bolstered by the recent Supreme Court precedent in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/17-1618_hfci.pdf">Bostock v. Clayton County</a>, judges recognize that discrimination against transgender individuals constitutes sex discrimination and is prohibited under US law.

The focus will shift toward a massive, nationwide mobilization of constitutional lawyers dedicated to dismantling the anti-trans legislation that has proliferated this year. Considering their previous successes, news of victorious lawsuits should uplift the community during this phase.

On May 5, 2023, Rep. Zooey Zephyr, Montana's first transgender representative and my beloved partner, proposed to me in front of hundreds of queer and trans individuals at Missoula's Queer Prom. I was delightedly caught completely off guard - while we had talked about potential proposals and rings, we had considered summer as the likely time to commit to spending the rest of our lives together. Clearly, Zooey had other plans. I want to use this opportunity to share with my readers the story of Zooey and I, the events that unfolded on that memorable Friday night, and the happiness we experienced together - a happiness we hope to harness in order to change the world for good.</p><p>I met Zooey nearly a year ago, as both of us were involved in activism around LGBTQ+ people. We very quickly hit it off as we found our Discord calls stretched far past the allotted time to talk about the causes we worked together on. I recall a moment when I casually tucked my hair behind my ear in a flirtatious manner, believing I was being subtle and sly. It turns out my attraction to her was quite apparent, a fact she would playfully rib me about as our relationship progressed.</p><p>It wasn't long before I began making cross-country trips to visit her in Missoula, while she took flights to stay with me in Washington, D.C. I had the privilege of witnessing her most significant moments. On election night, she shared the story of her flight landing after learning she had won, which included a flight attendant in tears because they had a transgender child. I saw her first challenging weeks in the legislature and comforted her during the state's severe attacks on trans people. Indeed, I was there to give her strength through recent events, covering her speech against the state's gender-affirming care ban, the Montana Freedom Caucus' call for her censure, the protests at the Capitol building, and her eventual expulsion from the House floor by a Republican supermajority. She rose to meet the moment and the world got to see the fierce and relentless advocate that I had come to love.</p><p>There were so many relentless attacks on her by the far right - they released her deadname (the old name given to trans people prior to transitioning and changing their names). They released old pictures of her. They sat in benches to prevent her from being able to sit right outside the legislative chambers to represent the people she had been sent there to speak for. They took her voice away on the House Floor. They didn&#8217;t know the woman I knew - if they had, they never would have tried - the one who would only go stronger with every swing they threw at her. Let me tell you about the real Zooey Zephyr.</p><p>Zooey is a compassionate individual who genuinely feels the impact of each person who tells her how her actions have transformed their lives. She sheds tears of happiness upon learning that she has helped even just one person accept themselves or their family. Zooey truly cares about the people in her community, all of them. Her love for her state and home is evident in her enthusiasm when showing me her favorite local coffee shops, clothing stores, and scenic parks. Her face lights up with pride as she shares stories about western Montana, Glacier National Park, the vastness of Flathead Lake, and hikes up to the "M." Her joy is infectious. She speaks about the people who reside there in the same manner, and they acknowledge her empathetic advocacy with knowing glances, hugs, and joyful thanks wherever she goes.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.erininthemorning.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Please support my independent reporting and activism on transgender legislation by subscribing. You help me keep this going and keep people informed.</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email&#8230;" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><p>The Zooey I know is the woman who snuggles with me after a tough day, her smile bringing comfort. She always knows the right words to say and the perfect way to deliver them. Her soothing voice captivated me from the moment I first heard it. She's a playful soul with an impressive knowledge of anime series, a lover of philosophy, and an exceptional writer and storyteller. I once asked her to tell me a bedtime story, and for months, I drifted off to sleep as she expanded upon it, spinning an intricate plot seemingly out of nowhere. She shares a special bond with my son, who cherishes every moment spent with her. He even named a stuffed animal after her to remind him of her presence during the many weeks she's away for work.</p><p>We've known for some time that we were destined to be together forever. Early in our relationship, Zooey expressed her desire for a love that felt like home. Together, we discovered that and so much more, creating a love that feels like family. With this in mind, we've been contemplating our future together, discussing ring sizes and potential engagement plans. We initially considered the summer, but as Zooey faced and overcame those who sought to harm her and her constituents, I quickly arranged a trip to be by her side. Unbeknownst to me, my plans filled her with such joy that she retrieved the ring she intended to propose with later in the year and instead devised a plan to pop the question during Queer Prom.</p><p>And well&#8230; you can see what happened next:</p><div id="youtube2-6jF8rfyvVdk" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;6jF8rfyvVdk&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6jF8rfyvVdk?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>That night was among the most memorable of my life. Prior to the proposal, Zooey mingled with hundreds of queer, trans, and allied individuals who had gathered to celebrate a prom experience many LGBTQ+ adults never had the chance to enjoy. Every person she encountered radiated joy and thanks for her presence. Unbeknownst to them, she carried a backpack with a ring tucked away at the bottom. Nonbinary Representative SJ Howell spoke first, and their speech concluded with a heartfelt kiss with their partner, eliciting cheers from the crowd. So, when Zooey stepped up to deliver her speech about queer joy and resilience, it was no surprise that the audience responded with enthusiasm, inviting me to stand beside her. As she dropped to one knee and the crowd erupted in excitement, I was filled with overwhelming sense of joy, sharing this incredible moment with so many others.</p><p>Zooey's speech emphasized that the joy LGBTQ+ individuals bring to the world has the power to transform it. She highlighted the enduring presence and resilience of our community throughout history. It's this very strength that enabled Zooey to accomplish all that she has in the Montana legislature. Her unwavering optimism, relentless advocacy for her constituents, and her love for the state are all products of her belief in the power of joy and resilience. As she slipped the ring onto my finger, I realized that I would be an integral part of this journey for the rest of our lives.</p><p>Zooey and I are both trans. The aftermath of our proposal spread like wildfire and shocked us both in a wonderful way - LGBTQ+ magazines covered it and we even received congratulations from the White House itself! Likewise, a lot of people who have spewed hate over trans people seemed extremely confused at the idea that trans people could date each other - newsflash, gender and sexuality are different things and T4T (&#8220;trans for trans&#8221;) couples are fairly common in the LGBTQ+ community! We love each other for who we are as individuals and the way in which we, when together, make each other stronger. It was wonderful to see so many trans people in similar relationships appreciate the happiness we feel.</p><p>I am overjoyed to be the one who loves Zooey and the one she loves in return. We both share a deep commitment to making the world a better place, and we believe that together, we can achieve this goal. We also understand that the moments of happiness we share with each other and occasionally with the world can inspire others to do the same. In a world where trans people often face adversity and their lives are scrutinized, Zooey and I had the opportunity on Friday night to present an alternative vision. In this world, joy takes center stage, allowing us to create a world we are proud to inhabit, where love wins. I am honored to embark on this journey by her side.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.erininthemorning.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Please support my independent reporting and activism on transgender legislation by subscribing.

The spaces where we can exist without restrictions are dwindling, as governments in the United States and around the globe implement policies aimed at excluding us from daily life. From my vantage point in Maryland, a state with progressive policies such as the recent comprehensive healthcare protections for transgender individuals, I have watched this alarming trend unfold. Having been born and raised in Louisiana, I can't help but worry about the day my ability to return home might be jeopardized.</p><p>This concern became a reality for transgender individuals in Florida just yesterday. The state's <a href="https://legiscan.com/FL/text/H1521/2023">House Bill 1521</a>, which has now passed and is awaiting the governor's signature, will effectively relegate transgender people to second-class citizen status. Under this legislation, if a cisgender person demands that a transgender person leave a restroom corresponding to their gender identity, non-compliance will result in arrest and criminal penalties. As a post-op transgender woman who is consistently recognized as my correct gender, I can never safely use a male restroom. This new development underscores the harsh reality that the world is becoming increasingly inhospitable for people like me.</p><p>You can see the provisions here:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddc68da8-a7e1-42f9-9d25-4e5420fc9706_1374x372.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddc68da8-a7e1-42f9-9d25-4e5420fc9706_1374x372.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddc68da8-a7e1-42f9-9d25-4e5420fc9706_1374x372.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddc68da8-a7e1-42f9-9d25-4e5420fc9706_1374x372.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddc68da8-a7e1-42f9-9d25-4e5420fc9706_1374x372.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddc68da8-a7e1-42f9-9d25-4e5420fc9706_1374x372.png" width="1374" height="372" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ddc68da8-a7e1-42f9-9d25-4e5420fc9706_1374x372.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:372,&quot;width&quot;:1374,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:256392,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddc68da8-a7e1-42f9-9d25-4e5420fc9706_1374x372.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddc68da8-a7e1-42f9-9d25-4e5420fc9706_1374x372.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddc68da8-a7e1-42f9-9d25-4e5420fc9706_1374x372.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddc68da8-a7e1-42f9-9d25-4e5420fc9706_1374x372.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Bathroom Ban In Florida</figcaption></figure></div><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.erininthemorning.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Please support my independent reporting and activism on transgender legislation by subscribing.

It is crucial to understand that the term "public buildings" encompasses a wide range of facilities in this Florida legislation, including government-owned or leased structures such as major airports, stadiums, concert venues, parks, beaches, rest stops, convention centers, and universities. As transgender people continue to use restrooms that align with their gender identities, they will inevitably come into conflict with this law. The legislation effectively deputizes cisgender individuals as bathroom enforcers, tasking them with identifying and reporting suspected transgender people for arrest and subsequent gender investigation.</p><p>The ramifications are deeply troubling. What options do I have if I am traveling and my connecting flight is at a major Florida airport? What recourse is available to me if a significant convention takes place in Orlando? How can I possibly use a men's restroom when the majority of people perceive me as a woman and the facilities may not even provide the necessary accommodations I require as a post-op transgender woman with needs more akin to those of cisgender women? Who will safeguard me and others like me from potential violence?</p><p>I suspect that is the intent of this law - to make me feel like I cannot travel to or through the state. That was certainly the case whenever Christina Pushaw, who works under Governor Ron DeSantis, posted the &#8220;wave&#8221; emoji in response to a news article about many LGBTQ+ families leaving Florida. They know that these laws shrink the spaces in which LGBTQ+ people are allowed to exist freely, and they revel in it:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93f7e4f8-04af-4dd5-bd42-5b07296a1740_1114x710.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93f7e4f8-04af-4dd5-bd42-5b07296a1740_1114x710.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93f7e4f8-04af-4dd5-bd42-5b07296a1740_1114x710.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93f7e4f8-04af-4dd5-bd42-5b07296a1740_1114x710.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93f7e4f8-04af-4dd5-bd42-5b07296a1740_1114x710.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93f7e4f8-04af-4dd5-bd42-5b07296a1740_1114x710.png" width="1114" height="710" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/93f7e4f8-04af-4dd5-bd42-5b07296a1740_1114x710.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:710,&quot;width&quot;:1114,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:351336,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93f7e4f8-04af-4dd5-bd42-5b07296a1740_1114x710.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93f7e4f8-04af-4dd5-bd42-5b07296a1740_1114x710.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93f7e4f8-04af-4dd5-bd42-5b07296a1740_1114x710.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93f7e4f8-04af-4dd5-bd42-5b07296a1740_1114x710.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>This is not the first time the world has shrunk in this way for transgender people. Years ago, House Bill 2 passed in North Carolina that similarly banned transgender people from restrooms. In many ways, it was not as extreme as this Florida law - it did not specify criminal penalties, for instance. There was a massive backlash to it - <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2016/04/05/technology/paypal-north-carolina-lgbt/">Paypal</a> and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/04/deutsch-bank-north-carolina/477858/">Deutsche Bank</a> pulled out and the debacle cost the state over $3 billion. The failure of this law set the anti-trans movement back by 4 years - nobody dared pass another law like it after that. We are now back to those days, and it feels like the world is noticeably more hostile than it was back in 2016. </p><p>Florida is not the only place that seems out of reach of transgender people. Kansas has also recently enacted <a href="https://apnews.com/article/transgender-rights-bathroom-bill-kansas-cbdc14be5bf1fb6e1a0749cad52e8ebc">a bathroom ban</a>, although its enforcement methods remain unclear. Texas has repurposed <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/09/16/texas-trans-teens-investigation-child-abuse/">child abuse laws</a> to target the parents of transgender youth, while Missouri is <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/04/24/1171293057/missouri-attorney-general-transgender-adults-gender-affirming-health-care#:~:text=Press-,Missouri%20due%20to%20be%20first%20state%20to%20restrict%20adult%20gender,scheduled%20to%20take%20effect%20Thursday.">forcing transgender adults</a> off their necessary medication. In Montana, a <a href="https://montanafreepress.org/2023/02/06/montana-republicans-back-medical-conscience-bill/">religious right of refusal</a> has been established, which could enable care providers to deny services to LGBTQ+ individuals. Additionally, a Montana law now prohibits <a href="https://apps.montanafreepress.org/capitol-tracker-2023/bills/sb-458/#:~:text=Precludes%20legal%20recognition%20of%20transgender,Introduced">updating driver's licenses</a> for transgender people and dictates that they be buried under their assigned sex at birth. When watching anti-trans legislation from my perspective, I see a map with borders that seem to be getting increasingly &#8220;no-go&#8221; zones for people like me.</p><p>It is in this new world of harsh laws targeting transgender people that we now see <a href="https://www.eqfl.org/florida-travel-advisory">travel advisories</a> by LGBTQ+ organizations warning that places like Florida are not safe to travel. The final words of Equality Florida&#8217;s travel advisory are chilling, and not something you would ever expect to hear of a state in the United States:</p><blockquote><p>Taken in their totality, Florida&#8217;s slate of laws and policies targeting basic freedoms and rights pose a serious risk to the health and safety of those traveling to the state. We regret that these attacks have already led many to flee the state and are driving others to consider relocation. And, in a state whose economy is fueled by visitors from around the world, it is with great sadness that Equality Florida has had to take the extraordinary step of responding to inquiries by issuing an official advisory warning about the risks of travel to the state.</p></blockquote><p>What steps can we take in response to this troubling reality? It seems that for many of us, the increasingly restrictive landscape presents daunting choices. Should we meticulously plan our movements in a nation that claims to champion freedom, yet harbors pockets of political forces intent on erasing our existence? Do we resist, risking imprisonment in facilities designated for our assigned sex at birth, as dictated by these same laws? Do we lie low, hoping the situation improves, and what if it never does? As I contemplate the shrinking world we inhabit, I often wonder where the limit lies. I doubt that this will end with restroom restrictions. If it continues, what will be the ultimate outcome? I fear the worst.</p><p>In the meantime, I will seek out safe havens to offer support to those who are trapped and amplify their voices to the world, holding onto the hope of a better future where the promise of American freedom truly extends to people like me.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.erininthemorning.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Please support my independent reporting and activism on transgender legislation by subscribing.

The bill, <a href="https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2023R1/Downloads/MeasureDocument/HB2002/B-Engrossed">House Bill 2002</a>, would mandate that all transgender procedures that are part o the modern standards of care would be covered by any health insurance plans offered in the state. It would also expand abortion access on college campuses and ensure that students have access to medication abortion. House Bill 2002 also establishes legal protections for the privacy of caregivers who provide these treatments, preventing them from being targeted by an increasingly dangerous far right. The bill will now go to the Senate for consideration.</p><p>House Bill 2002 is part of a small series of bills that been enacted over the past two years that serve to broaden the scope of covered procedures for transgender individuals. The legislation includes treatments like hair removal, voice therapy, and facial feminization or masculinization surgery which are deemed medically essential and have huge life-improving effects for trans people. This expansion is particularly significant since most health insurance coverage, if it addresses transgender care at all, is typically limited to hormones and gender reassignment surgery.</p><p>Unfortunately, insurance plans in many states have fallen behind the times, covering only procedures recommended under <a href="https://www.cpath.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/WPATHsocv6.pdf">outdated standards of care</a>. In contrast, modern standards of care assert that health insurance should encompass a variety of treatment options proven to benefit transgender people. House Bill 2002 reflects a necessary step forward in bridging this gap.</p><p>See this statement from <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/26895269.2022.2100644">WPATH&#8217;s Standards Of Care 8</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Gender-affirming interventions may also include hair removal/transplant procedures, voice therapy/surgery, counseling, and other medical procedures required to effectively affirm an individual&#8217;s gender identity and reduce gender incongruence and dysphoria.</p></blockquote><p>Here is a list of expanded procedures the bill itself mandates:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70eb1275-0996-43e1-9f98-b0747ed2de5e_683x227.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70eb1275-0996-43e1-9f98-b0747ed2de5e_683x227.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70eb1275-0996-43e1-9f98-b0747ed2de5e_683x227.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70eb1275-0996-43e1-9f98-b0747ed2de5e_683x227.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70eb1275-0996-43e1-9f98-b0747ed2de5e_683x227.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70eb1275-0996-43e1-9f98-b0747ed2de5e_683x227.png" width="683" height="227" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/70eb1275-0996-43e1-9f98-b0747ed2de5e_683x227.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:227,&quot;width&quot;:683,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:72807,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70eb1275-0996-43e1-9f98-b0747ed2de5e_683x227.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70eb1275-0996-43e1-9f98-b0747ed2de5e_683x227.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70eb1275-0996-43e1-9f98-b0747ed2de5e_683x227.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70eb1275-0996-43e1-9f98-b0747ed2de5e_683x227.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Expanded procedures to be covered in Oregon if HB2002 passes</figcaption></figure></div><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.erininthemorning.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Please support my independent reporting and activism on transgender legislation by subscribing.

In 2021, Washington passed <a href="https://www.insurance.wa.gov/news/rule-protect-gender-affirming-medical-treatment-takes-effect-jan-1">similar protections</a> that mandate expanded coverage for gender affirming care treatments. Colorado likewise passed a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/14/1046140320/colorado-now-requires-gender-affirming-care-to-be-covered-by-private-health-insu">similar law</a>. In 2022, Hawaii <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/06/17/hawaii-transgender-affirming-care-law/">passed legislation </a>covering these procedures, though the negotiations were tense and there were fears that the bill could be spiked in the final days of debate. This year, Maryland passed the <a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/SB0460?ys=2023RS">Trans Health Equity Act</a>, which only applies to state-run insurance programs like Medicaid. Should Oregon&#8217;s bill pass, it will be a significant step forward in continuing to protect the rights of transgender people in a year where these rights are under heavy fire.</p><p>The bill does not stop at transgender care, however. It also expands abortion protections and patient and provider confidentiality. One section of the bill states that college campus student health centers must provide students with access to emergency contraception and abortion. It also expands the right to access abortions for minors and removes any parental consent requirements around obtaining an abortion. Abortion issues and trans issues are increasingly paired together in protective bills around the United States - the <a href="https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/washington-becomes-10th-state-to">trans refuge/shield laws</a>, for instance, tend to include abortion, reproductive healthcare, and gender affirming care protections all under the same protective bills.</p><p>Gender affirming care is lifesaving. Recent studies show a <a href="https://www.hcplive.com/view/suicide-risk-reduces-73-transgender-nonbinary-youths-gender-affirming-care">73% reduction</a> in suicide rates for people who can obtain medical transition. Another study shows a <a href="https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(21)00568-1/fulltext">40% reduction</a> in 1-year suicide attempts. The Center for the Study of Inequality at Cornell University <a href="https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-well-being-of-transgender-people/">compiled 51 such studies</a> showing the medical and psychological benefits of transitioning for trans people. Expanded standards of care give doctors a larger set of tools to treat gender dysphoria and increase the safety for transgender people who seek to &#8220;pass&#8221; as their gender. This last part is important for trans people visiting red states and encountering increasingly hostile political environments where they may be targeted.</p><p>The bill passed 36-23 along party lines. It will now go to the Senate, where it will skip over committee hearings due to it having already been heard in a joint committee with both House and Senate members. Transgender advocates in the state believe that with enough pressure, it could pass into law quickly. Should it do so, Oregon will cement itself as one of the most protective states for transgender residents.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.erininthemorning.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Please support my independent reporting and activism on transgender legislation by subscribing.

This legislative digest aims to help navigate these complexities. At present, numerous bills targeting the transgender community are making their way across the United States. Though the <a href="https://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps">Movement Advancement Project's</a> comprehensive equality maps provide an overview of many of these bills, this digest delves further, concentrating on four categories of legislation: hormone therapy bans, drag bans, bills that effectively erase transgender individuals from legal recognition, and safe state/refuge/shield laws designed to safeguard transgender people and providers from prosecution related to gender-affirming care.</p><p>There has been a noticeable uptick in laws targeting the transgender community across these categories. To date, 16 states have enacted bans on hormone therapy and puberty blockers for transgender minors, with one state extending the restrictions to transgender adults. It is worth mentioning that Missouri's heavily restrictive ban on adult transgender individuals is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/26/politics/missouri-transgender-gender-affirming-care-lawsuit-blocked/index.html">now enjoined in court</a>. Furthermore, there has been a surge in drag bans, including the first one to pass a state legislature since Tennessee's was halted in court &#8211; this ban was <a href="https://laws.leg.mt.gov/legprd/LAW0210W$BSIV.ActionQuery?P_BILL_NO1=359&amp;P_BLTP_BILL_TYP_CD=HB&amp;Z_ACTION=Find&amp;P_SESS=20231">passed in Montana</a>, though it must still go through conference commtitee. Lastly, there has been an increase in bills that define trans people out of the law entirely, with catastrophic consequences - three states have passed these bills since the last update.</p><p>There has been much good news in recent weeks as well. Missouri&#8217;s ban being enjoined in court has given trans people in the state a little room to breathe. States are also continuing to expand legal protections for trans people. Every few weeks another state passes a shield law that protects trans people, their families, and their providers seeking refuge from anti-trans states from prosecution.</p><p>Here are the updates on the major categories of bills moving:</p><h3>Gender Affirming Care Bans</h3><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F51460275-8973-482c-bc9c-9973b7cd987d_1598x929.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F51460275-8973-482c-bc9c-9973b7cd987d_1598x929.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F51460275-8973-482c-bc9c-9973b7cd987d_1598x929.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F51460275-8973-482c-bc9c-9973b7cd987d_1598x929.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F51460275-8973-482c-bc9c-9973b7cd987d_1598x929.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F51460275-8973-482c-bc9c-9973b7cd987d_1598x929.png" width="1456" height="846" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/51460275-8973-482c-bc9c-9973b7cd987d_1598x929.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:846,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:240665,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F51460275-8973-482c-bc9c-9973b7cd987d_1598x929.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F51460275-8973-482c-bc9c-9973b7cd987d_1598x929.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F51460275-8973-482c-bc9c-9973b7cd987d_1598x929.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F51460275-8973-482c-bc9c-9973b7cd987d_1598x929.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Map of State Laws Banning All Hormone Therapy and Blockers For trans Youth</figcaption></figure></div><p>There are now 16 states that ban all hormone therapy or puberty blockers for transgender youth. Some of these states mandate forced detransition and tell doctors how to do it, like <a href="https://legiscan.com/SD/text/HB1080/2023">South Dakota</a> and <a href="https://legiscan.com/KY/text/SB150/2023">Kentucky</a>. Some states like <a href="https://legiscan.com/MS/text/HB1125/2023">Mississippi</a> and <a href="https://legiscan.com/IN/text/SB0480/2023">Indiana</a> criminalize &#8220;aiding and abetting&#8221; gender affirming care. This could be used to target people such as vocal coaches, hair stylists, and therapists who help transgender youth with their gender presentations. Of these bills, 3 have been blocked or enjoined in court.</p><p>The newest bills to pass are <a href="https://leg.mt.gov/bills/2023/billpdf/SB0099.pdf">Montana&#8217;s Senate Bill 99</a> and Oklahoma&#8217;s <a href="https://legiscan.com/OK/bill/SB613/2023">Senate Bill 613</a>. These bills have especially cruel provisions that show the increasing ways in which these legislators are cruelly targeting trans youth. Montana&#8217;s SB99 is the first bill that has provisions against social transition in schools and federal buildings. Meanwhile, Oklahoma&#8217;s SB613 is one of the few bills that have been passed that specifies felony penalties for gender affirming care providers who violate the law. Oklahoma&#8217;s still needs to be signed by the governor, who is expected to do so.</p><p>One piece of good news in this category is the current fate of Missouri&#8217;s gender affirming care ban decree from Attorney General Andrew Bailey. On the last digest, Missouri was placed in a new category on this map: bills that ban care for transgender adults. Just last week, the Missouri Attorney General&#8217;s ban was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/26/politics/missouri-transgender-gender-affirming-care-lawsuit-blocked/index.html">enjoined in court</a>. It will be heard this week where it may be enjoined for a longer period of time.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.erininthemorning.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Please support my independent reporting and activism on transgender legislation by subscribing.

These bills may appear straightforward at first glance and are frequently argued as such in state legislatures. However, the harm they inflict is extensive. By legally excluding transgender people from the definition of sex, a single bill can impact a multitude of rights and legal provisions: transgender individuals may lose their rights to accurate birth certificates, death certificates, driver's licenses, bathroom access, non-discrimination protections, and more. They are also extremely costly to implement: Montana&#8217;s bill came with a fiscal note of up to <a href="https://montanafreepress.org/2023/03/27/montana-could-lose-any-all-or-none-of-its-7-5-billion-federal-special-revenue-authority/">$7.5 billion dollars</a>.</p><p>Three states have passed such bills since the last update. Kansas <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/lgbtq/3978481-kansas-enacts-sweeping-transgender-bathroom-bill/">passed bill</a> that not only defines sex in a way that excludes trans people, but it codifies into law an adult bathroom ban - though how that ban will be enforced is anybody&#8217;s guess considering that the law has no penalties specified. <a href="https://www.ndlegis.gov/assembly/68-2023/regular/bill-overview/bo1474.html">North Dakota</a> has passed a similar law, sans the bathroom ban provision. <a href="https://legiscan.com/MT/text/SB458/2023">Montana's bill</a> is far-reaching as well; in addition to redefining sex in a way that excludes intersex people, it amends 41 sections of code with the new definition of sex. It is worth mentioning that this bill marked the first occasion when Representative Zooey Zephyr of Montana <a href="https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/let-her-speak-representative-zephyrs">was silenced</a> while attempting to speak on the matter.</p><h3>Drag Bans</h3><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabdc3765-35e2-4382-8a27-143484c06ba1_1610x998.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabdc3765-35e2-4382-8a27-143484c06ba1_1610x998.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabdc3765-35e2-4382-8a27-143484c06ba1_1610x998.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabdc3765-35e2-4382-8a27-143484c06ba1_1610x998.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabdc3765-35e2-4382-8a27-143484c06ba1_1610x998.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabdc3765-35e2-4382-8a27-143484c06ba1_1610x998.png" width="1456" height="903" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/abdc3765-35e2-4382-8a27-143484c06ba1_1610x998.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:903,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:232062,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabdc3765-35e2-4382-8a27-143484c06ba1_1610x998.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabdc3765-35e2-4382-8a27-143484c06ba1_1610x998.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabdc3765-35e2-4382-8a27-143484c06ba1_1610x998.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabdc3765-35e2-4382-8a27-143484c06ba1_1610x998.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Bills that would ban drag in public</figcaption></figure></div><p>For a while, it seemed as if drag bans would stall around the United States. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-judge-blocks-tennessee-law-restricting-drag-shows/">Tennessee&#8217;s drag ban</a> was enjoined in court. <a href="https://www.fayettevilleflyer.com/2023/02/06/arkansas-house-passes-amended-bill-that-no-longer-targets-drag-performances/#:~:text=The%20bill%20no%20longer%20explicitly,considered%20%E2%80%9Cadult%2Doriented.%22&amp;text=The%20Arkansas%20House%20voted%20Monday,complaints%20from%20the%20LGBTQ%20community.">Arkansas</a> and <a href="https://www.inforum.com/news/north-dakota/north-dakota-lawmakers-water-down-bill-that-would-have-banned-public-drag-shows#:~:text=BISMARCK%20%E2%80%94%20A%20North%20Dakota%20bill,the%20state's%20existing%20obscenity%20laws.">North Dakota</a> amended their drag bans to instead be bans on general nudity in public.

States with Democratic majorities, growing concerned about the anti-transgender legislation spreading across the nation, have been more proactive in passing bills that safeguard abortion and gender-affirming care patients and providers from interference originating out of state. As a result, individuals seeking care in these states, after crossing the border from a state with criminalizing laws, will be protected from actions such as subpoenas and extradition requests. Some of these bills even shield transgender children from being removed from the state in custody disputes when one parent seeks to force them to detransition.</p><p>This week, the newest law has <a href="https://vtdigger.org/2023/04/27/with-reproductive-shield-bills-vermont-lawmakers-seek-to-be-a-beacon-of-hope-for-transgender-patients/">passed in Vermont</a>, bringing the total number of states that explicitly protect gender affirming care p to 11. The Vermont law still needs to be signed by the governor - it passed both legislative chambers with overwhelming veto-proof majorities. </p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.erininthemorning.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Please support my independent reporting and activism on transgender legislation by subscribing.

During legislative hearings, few individuals voice support for bills targeting transgender youth, while opposition consistently floods the proceedings. The 2022 elections echoed this sentiment, as candidates and state parties that directed their campaign spending toward anti-trans attack ads experienced resounding losses in most instances. Polls have consistently shown that the majority of people oppose legislation seeking to ban gender-affirming care for transgender youth.</p><p>A recent <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/04/Fox_April-21-24-2023_National_Topline_April-26-Release.pdf">Fox News poll</a>, employing a unique framing of the question, sheds light on precisely why these political attacks fail to secure victories. The survey reveals that 86% of respondents consider "politically motivated attacks on trans kids" to be a problem, with 57% characterizing these attacks as a "major problem." This data underscores the growing consensus that targeting transgender youth is not a winning political strategy.</p><p>See the toplines of the poll here:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca4d899c-019b-48b6-88d8-18ca0c47355f_645x185.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca4d899c-019b-48b6-88d8-18ca0c47355f_645x185.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca4d899c-019b-48b6-88d8-18ca0c47355f_645x185.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca4d899c-019b-48b6-88d8-18ca0c47355f_645x185.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca4d899c-019b-48b6-88d8-18ca0c47355f_645x185.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca4d899c-019b-48b6-88d8-18ca0c47355f_645x185.png" width="645" height="185" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ca4d899c-019b-48b6-88d8-18ca0c47355f_645x185.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:185,&quot;width&quot;:645,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Image&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Image" title="Image" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca4d899c-019b-48b6-88d8-18ca0c47355f_645x185.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca4d899c-019b-48b6-88d8-18ca0c47355f_645x185.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca4d899c-019b-48b6-88d8-18ca0c47355f_645x185.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca4d899c-019b-48b6-88d8-18ca0c47355f_645x185.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/04/Fox_April-21-24-2023_National_Topline_April-26-Release.pdf">Fox News Poll: &#8220;Are families with trans children being targets of political attacks a problem?&#8221;</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>This result is stunning. Although numerous surveys have explored personal opinions on transgender policies concerning sports, healthcare, and education, few polls have delved into public sentiment about the broad wave of legislation itself that targets transgender individuals. This Fox News poll shows that while polls may vary on individual topics and wording, overall, the American public is increasingly growing alarmed at anti-trans legislation and politics. This trend may well portend disaster for a Republican Party that has seemingly succumbed to the influence of the far-right and fervently pursued anti-transgender policies.</p><p>This would be a bad enough result for the organizations that are pushing these policies and the candidates campaigning on them. However, another finding in this poll exacerbates the perils associated with pursuing anti-transgender policies. Out of all the issues that matter to the American populace, transgender-related concerns ranked tied at the very bottom.</p><p>See this result:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11019edf-830e-44a8-bb27-209b0bf86531_617x501.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11019edf-830e-44a8-bb27-209b0bf86531_617x501.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11019edf-830e-44a8-bb27-209b0bf86531_617x501.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11019edf-830e-44a8-bb27-209b0bf86531_617x501.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11019edf-830e-44a8-bb27-209b0bf86531_617x501.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11019edf-830e-44a8-bb27-209b0bf86531_617x501.png" width="617" height="501" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/11019edf-830e-44a8-bb27-209b0bf86531_617x501.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:501,&quot;width&quot;:617,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;What do you think is the most important issue facing the country today?

Currently, over <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fTxHLjBa86GA7WCT-V6AbEMGRFPMJndnaVGoZZX4PMw/edit?usp=sharing">515 anti-transgender bills</a> are being proposed or passed in state legislatures throughout the United States. Spurred by organizations such as the American Principles Project and the Alliance Defending Freedom, the GOP has adopted this issue as its primary focus. Many Republican lawmakers seem unable to go a single day without discussing it, while Freedom Caucus social media accounts incessantly emphasize anti-transgender politics. It is highly likely that a barrage of anti-transgender attack ads will inundate television screens during the 2024 general election, just as they did in 2022. The chasm between the public's concerns regarding transgender issues and the Republican Party's actions could not be more profound.</p><p>In 2022, the American Principles Project invested <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/4ax57w/anti-trans-attack-ads-midterms">$50 million</a> in anti-transgender attack ads. Candidates across numerous states campaigned on anti-transgender issues. For example, in Georgia, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVmBKhAH7ms">Herschel Walker</a> was joined by anti-transgender swimmer Riley Gaines in the final weeks of the campaign to attack Senator Warnock. In Arizona, Kari Lake focused on <a href="https://tennesseestar.com/the-west/arizona/kari-lake-rips-katie-hobbs-support-for-trans-teens-bodies-being-mutilated/sberry/2022/11/08/">Katie Hobbs' husband's support</a> for transgender teens during the closing weeks of her campaign. Michigan witnessed <a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2022/11/11/michigan-gop-finger-pointing-underway-following-tuesdays-historic-loss-at-the-polls/">millions of dollars</a> spent on anti-transgender ads, while <a href="https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/dems-win-huge-supreme-court-race">in Wisconsin</a>, advertisements promoting the Republican Supreme Court candidate inundated the state due to the Democratic candidate's support for trans individuals. One common thread connects all these races: Republicans suffered resounding defeats, unable to capitalize on an anti-transgender message they seem increasingly eager to embrace this year.</p><p>Moving forward, it seems like this strategy that the Republican Party seems unable or unwilling to back off of may backfire in a tremendous fashion. In the meantime, Democrats seem completely unwilling to cede any ground. A poll like this means they are even less likely to do so in the future.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.erininthemorning.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Please support my independent reporting and activism on transgender legislation by subscribing.

While the majority of American bills targeting transgender care have focused on youth, the Texas law takes it a step further, potentially stripping essential care from countless transgender adults. Instead of implementing a direct ban on care like other bills, this legislation insidiously imposes a prohibitively onerous financial disincentive, which could effectively leave physicians unable to provide the necessary treatment. This alarming development marks a significant escalation in anti-trans legislation, as it now targets adults and mirrors a concerning trend recently observed in several other states.</p><p><a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB1029/id/2781907">Senate Bill 1029</a> outlines a series of constraints designed to render gender-affirming care virtually impossible to provide. One such constraint stipulates that health insurance companies covering gender-affirming care would face increased liability to transgender patients. Another limitation bars the use of "public money" for gender-affirming care &#8211; a vague restriction that could result in entire hospital systems, which receive any public funding, being unable to offer this care. Most alarming, however, is a provision granting doctors lifetime liability for providing gender-affirming care, even in the absence of malpractice. This provision would mean that doctors would not be able to maintain malpractice insurance that covers their practice and thus would be unable to provide care. Collectively, these restrictions bear a striking resemblance to TRAP Laws (Targeted Restrictions on Abortion Providers), which are often employed to obstruct abortion care within a state.</p><p>You can see the doctor liability provisions here:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e7c622e-04ca-4b92-ba32-f16cd553cf43_587x270.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e7c622e-04ca-4b92-ba32-f16cd553cf43_587x270.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e7c622e-04ca-4b92-ba32-f16cd553cf43_587x270.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e7c622e-04ca-4b92-ba32-f16cd553cf43_587x270.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e7c622e-04ca-4b92-ba32-f16cd553cf43_587x270.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e7c622e-04ca-4b92-ba32-f16cd553cf43_587x270.png" width="587" height="270" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0e7c622e-04ca-4b92-ba32-f16cd553cf43_587x270.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:270,&quot;width&quot;:587,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:19347,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e7c622e-04ca-4b92-ba32-f16cd553cf43_587x270.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e7c622e-04ca-4b92-ba32-f16cd553cf43_587x270.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e7c622e-04ca-4b92-ba32-f16cd553cf43_587x270.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e7c622e-04ca-4b92-ba32-f16cd553cf43_587x270.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Doctor liability with no malpractice for gender affirming care.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.erininthemorning.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Please support my independent reporting and activism on transgender legislation by subscribing.

With a doctors being unable to utilize malpractice insurance and the prohibition of public funds and Medicaid coverage for care, access to treatment may become increasingly limited. The increased risk to private health insurance providers serves as a means of discouraging coverage, while targeting doctors who provide the care further exacerbates the situation. As a result, both transgender adults and providers may encounter insurmountable barriers to accessing necessary treatment. Should it pass, Texas would become the second state to implement such extreme measures against adult care, following Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey's order, which essentially prohibits gender-affirming care for most transgender adults in the state.</p><p>Local activists and organizations agree. In an <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/04/25/transgender-health-care-legislature/">interview with the Texas Tribune</a>, Christopher Hamilton of Texas Health Action stated, &#8220;It really is just an attempt to chill health care for all trans people.&#8221;</p><p>Texas is the latest state to target gender-affirming care for transgender adults, but we have witnessed similar actions in other states as well. Missouri r<a href="https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/trans-adults-officially-being-detransitioned">ecently imposed a series of stringent restrictions</a> on gender-affirming care. In a baffling Catch-22, Missouri's new guidelines necessitate resolving issues like depression and anxiety before initiating gender-affirming care while simultaneously demanding severe dysphoria to qualify for the treatment. Since severe dysphoria often causes anxiety and depression, successfully addressing these mental health concerns might result in dysphoria no longer being classified as "severe," thereby prohibiting treatment. Conversely, if a doctor cannot alleviate the depression and anxiety, the treatment would still be banned due to &#8220;unresolved mental health issues.&#8221; Ultimately, this leads to a de facto ban on all transgender care. The Missouri policy is being heard in court today in hopes of obtaining a temporary restraining order blocking it from taking effect.</p><p>Gender affirming care is proven to save lives. It reduces anxiety and depression, helps give transgender people congruence with their own bodies, and aids in existing as a member of their gender identity in public. One recent study showed a <a href="https://www.hcplive.com/view/suicide-risk-reduces-73-transgender-nonbinary-youths-gender-affirming-care">73% lower suicide rate</a> for people allowed to medically transition, and similar drops in depression and anxiety. Another showed a<a href="https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(21)00568-1/fulltext"> 40% reduction </a>in attempts over the last year. There are many more studies that have been done on this care - The Center for the Study of Inequality at Cornell University <a href="https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-well-being-of-transgender-people/">compiled 51 such studies</a> showing the medical and psychological benefits of transitioning for trans people.</p><p>In recent years, we have seen an increased targeting of adult gender affirming care by major figures and organizations in the anti-trans movement. <a href="https://twitter.com/genspect/status/1559714294987726850">Genspect</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210115133143/https://twitter.com/mimmymum/status/1349739376612356096">Transgender Trend</a>, well funded and active organizations campaigning on behalf of anti-trans laws, have lobbied to increase healthcare bans up to age 25. <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/cpac-speaker-transgender-people-eradicated-1234690924/">Michael Knowles </a>and <a href="https://twitter.com/MattWalshBlog/status/1650820850252238849?s=20">Matt Walsh</a> have recently gotten fully behind transgender &#8220;eradication,&#8221; with Matt Walsh recently stating that gender affirming care should be available to nobody. This is significant given Walsh&#8217;s hand in drafting and supporting anti-trans bills.</p><p>As legislative sessions continue across the nation, we can expect more of these bills and policies to emerge. Heading into 2024, this issue is likely to become more nationalized as presidential candidates and far-right Republicans attempt to exploit the fear campaign they have instigated against gender-affirming care. Fortunately, there is a glimmer of hope for the transgender community, as anti-trans legislation and candidates who champion these platforms often lack widespread popularity during elections. The outcome of the 2024 election cycle could prove crucial in safeguarding transgender rights for the foreseeable future.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.erininthemorning.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Please support my independent reporting and activism on transgender legislation by subscribing.

In response, Montanans from her district and across the state gathered in the gallery, chanting to let her voice be heard. Authorities then proceeded to arrest eight individuals and blocked Rep. Zephyr from speaking. Meanwhile, in Tennessee, after showing support for protesters against gun violence, the legislature <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tennessee-expulsion-house-democrats-expelled-what-happens-now/">voted to expel</a> the two black lawmakers who had showed solidarity. Over in Oklahoma, nonbinary Representative Mauree Turner <a href="https://19thnews.org/2023/03/oklahoma-censures-nonbinary-lawmaker-mauree-turner/">faced censure</a> for providing shelter to a member of a crowd protesting for transgender rights in the capital. This growing pattern highlights a troubling trend: the GOP seems increasingly eager to undermine democracy by targeting minority voices and their representatives.</p><p>To provide context for Representative Zephyr's situation, let's revisit the events of April 20th. On that day, the Montana Senate considered <a href="https://leg.mt.gov/bills/2023/billhtml/SB0099.htm">SB99</a>, a bill that forcibly medically detransitions transgender youth. Zephyr delivered a powerful speech against the legislation, asserting that she hoped those who vote for the bill would see the blood on their hands. In retaliation, the GOP blocked Zephyr from speaking on any subsequent bills, stating that the Speaker could &#8220;acknowledge anyone he chooses.&#8221; This move blatantly subverted the democratic process and effectively disenfranchised her entire district. To add salt to the wound, the first bill on which Zephyr was denied her right to speak was <a href="https://leg.mt.gov/bills/2023/SB0499/SB0458_1.pdf">SB458</a>, which redefines sex in a manner that essentially erases transgender individuals from up to 40 sections of the legal code. In doing so, the GOP symbolically erased Zephyr herself, along with the community she belongs to.</p><p>See the exchange that led to all of this here:</p><div id="youtube2-1XjF_ReXEXs" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;1XjF_ReXEXs&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1XjF_ReXEXs?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>What happened next was a scene that has become familiar to citizens across the country. The GOP, driven by their hatred and fear of a minority speaking on behalf o their community, reacted by escalating their rhetoric and stating that Rep. Zephyr should not be heard for the remainder of the session. When her constituents showed up and packed the gallery with over a hundred demonstrators, the speaker held a vote on if she would be allowed to speak - the GOP voted to not allow her on party lines. Following that, the crowd erupted and the speaker called the sergeant at arms to clear them. Representative Zephyr stood and lifted her microphone high in solidarity:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b6e8b2f-3537-497a-bd84-71471dcff164_828x556.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b6e8b2f-3537-497a-bd84-71471dcff164_828x556.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b6e8b2f-3537-497a-bd84-71471dcff164_828x556.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b6e8b2f-3537-497a-bd84-71471dcff164_828x556.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b6e8b2f-3537-497a-bd84-71471dcff164_828x556.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b6e8b2f-3537-497a-bd84-71471dcff164_828x556.png" width="828" height="556" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0b6e8b2f-3537-497a-bd84-71471dcff164_828x556.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:556,&quot;width&quot;:828,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:757148,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b6e8b2f-3537-497a-bd84-71471dcff164_828x556.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b6e8b2f-3537-497a-bd84-71471dcff164_828x556.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b6e8b2f-3537-497a-bd84-71471dcff164_828x556.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b6e8b2f-3537-497a-bd84-71471dcff164_828x556.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><a href="https://www.mtpr.org/montana-news/2023-04-24/protests-trans-lawmaker-montana-capitol">Rep.

Members of the <a href="https://twitter.com/MTFreedomCaucus/status/1650654469951193088?s=20">Republican Montana Freedom Caucus</a> have officially demanded "discipline" for Representative Zephyr. Press conferences are slated for today, and conservative commentators have already dubbed the incident an <a href="https://twitter.com/TomFitton/status/1650653297580077056?s=20">"insurrection"</a> in a perplexing display of projection. Despite the absence of violence and the release of all protesters from custody, the Montana GOP seems poised to double down on their subversion of the democratic process by potentially taking formal action against Zephyr.</p><p>I cannot help but wonder: have they learned nothing at all? Merely weeks ago, in a state far away, the "Tennessee Three" stood united on the legislative floor, expressing solidarity with protesters above. Representative Justin Jones raised a sign and a bullhorn, ensuring that those in the rafters felt heard. Representatives Gloria Johnson and Justin Pearson also demonstrated support. Tennessee Republicans hastily labeled the event an <a href="https://twitter.com/joelpollak/status/1650887545583194112?s=20">"insurrection&#8221;</a> in a similar fashion to Montana Republicans. It was unsurprising, though no less disheartening, when the House voted to expel only the two black lawmakers involved, while allowing their white counterpart to remain.</p><div id="youtube2-26JK69-SV28" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;26JK69-SV28&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/26JK69-SV28?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>Weeks before that, Representative Mauree Turner supported demonstrators at the Oklahoma Capitol who were protesting a bill comparable to Montana's SB99, which would force transgender youth to undergo medical detransition. Amid the protests, Turner offered shelter to one of the activists in their office. Once again, legislators and conservative commentators branded the events an <a href="https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1622980177910198272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1622980177910198272%7Ctwgr%5Eb1adb105c828a6955f030fe603aaaabdff36983a%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oklahoman.com%2Fstory%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2Fgovernment%2F2023%2F02%2F08%2Fgov-stitt-says-transgender-rights-protest-at-okla-capitol-peaceful%2F69886044007%2F">"insurrection"</a> &#8211; a term they appear eager to apply to peaceful protests yet reluctant to use for actual violent disruptions of democracy, such as the events of January 6.</p><p>Representative Turner responded with bite:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;I know that I represent a culmination of things that y&#8217;all deeply hate. I know it makes it easier for you to try to silence the people of House District 88, because we continually hold you accountable. We push you to be better to take care of Oklahoma. What happened last week in my office was the same thing that happens all the time. People do not feel represented or protected by this body.&#8221;</p></blockquote><div id="youtube2-Dv8xwhNxP_s" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;Dv8xwhNxP_s&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Dv8xwhNxP_s?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>A troubling trend is emerging in state governments, as minority voices face increasingly undemocratic actions from lawmakers who have consistently legislated against their rights. Black and brown individuals, transgender and nonbinary people, are holding GOP-dominated legislative bodies accountable and refusing to let their actions go unchallenged. In return, these GOP-controlled legislatures are not satisfied with merely passing bills; they seek silence from those most affected by their actions, demanding complicity to harm these communities with impunity. It was this veneer of a clear conscience that Representative Zephyr shattered, sparking the ire of the Montana legislature and leading them to silence both her and her constituents.</p><p>Following the protest in the Montana State House, Representative Zephyr passionately called out this dynamic and <a href="https://twitter.com/ErinInTheMorn/status/1650665711075721216?s=20">addressed it</a> during an interview:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;What you heard today is people standing for democracy. People standing to let their voices be heard in that floor. And what you are watching here is you are watching people who do not want to see democracy in action. They want to strip us of our rights, and its not enough for them to get the harmful bills through. When someone stands up and calls out their bills for the harm they cause, for the deaths they cause, they want silence, and we will not be complicit in our eradication.&#8221;</p></blockquote><div id="youtube2-ajnb3AXtq9A" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;ajnb3AXtq9A&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ajnb3AXtq9A?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>It's crucial to recognize that the GOP's subversion of democratic processes in response to marginalized groups is not resonating well, neither in states they govern nor on a national level. The <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/americans-hold-mixed-views-expulsion-two-tennessee-lawmakers">vast majority</a> of the American public believes that lawmakers have the right to peacefully protest in statehouses and legislatures. After attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, the Republican party in various states has advocated for <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/republicans-continue-push-decertification-2020-election/story?id=83794526">decertifying elections</a>. The American public must pay close attention to the events in Tennessee, Oklahoma, and Montana to grasp the anti-democratic and perilous agenda the GOP is pushing. While they may target minority lawmakers by undermining democracy today, they are honing their tactics for a broader assault on the nation in 2024.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.erininthemorning.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Please support my independent reporting and activism on transgender legislation by subscribing.

The bill, entitled the "Trans Refuge Bill," protects transgender people residing in or receiving healthcare in Minnesota from having their records subpoenaed or warrants issued for alleged "crimes" linked to their medical care. Minnesota now joins <a href="https://erininthemorn.substack.com/p/adult-trans-bans-drag-laws-and-more">nine other states</a> with similar laws protecting trans refugees.</p><p>One aspect of the law grants the state increased authority and jurisdiction in child custody cases involving gender-affirming care and the potential discontinuation of such care. However, misinformation quickly circulated among conservative social media accounts, falsely claiming that the bill permits the state to remove children from parents who do not affirm their gender. This assertion is a deliberate misinterpretation of what the bill does. </p><p>One example of this misinformation was shared <a href="https://twitter.com/covid_clarity/status/1649440102542905344?s=20">&#8220;Covid Clarity,&#8221;</a> a far right anti-vaxxer account:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/covid_clarity/status/1649440102542905344?s=20"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F696541e9-0462-47dc-99fd-7c2ea574d19b_1156x928.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F696541e9-0462-47dc-99fd-7c2ea574d19b_1156x928.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F696541e9-0462-47dc-99fd-7c2ea574d19b_1156x928.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F696541e9-0462-47dc-99fd-7c2ea574d19b_1156x928.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F696541e9-0462-47dc-99fd-7c2ea574d19b_1156x928.png" width="518" height="415.83391003460207" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/696541e9-0462-47dc-99fd-7c2ea574d19b_1156x928.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:928,&quot;width&quot;:1156,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:518,&quot;bytes&quot;:570156,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/covid_clarity/status/1649440102542905344?s=20&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F696541e9-0462-47dc-99fd-7c2ea574d19b_1156x928.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F696541e9-0462-47dc-99fd-7c2ea574d19b_1156x928.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F696541e9-0462-47dc-99fd-7c2ea574d19b_1156x928.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F696541e9-0462-47dc-99fd-7c2ea574d19b_1156x928.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>This falsehood was also shared across right-wing news sites. Fox News stated that the bill would <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/minnesota-advances-trans-refuge-bill-opponents-strip-custody-non-consenting-parents">&#8220;strip custody from non-consenting parents.&#8221;</a> The Washington Free Beacon ran a headline stating that you <a href="https://freebeacon.com/latest-news/you-no-longer-have-access-to-your-child-gop-state-rep-slams-minnesotas-trans-refuge-bill/">&#8220;would no longer have access to your child.&#8221; </a>A live interview on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6323417520112">Fox &amp; Friends</a> led in with &#8220;the bill could strip custody from parents.&#8221; Several social media accounts took it even further and stated that the trans youth from non-affirming parents would become &#8220;wards of the state&#8221; under the bill.</p><p>Though the bills protections are far-ranging, these statements are extreme mischaracterizations of what the bill does. The legislation primarily accomplishes two objectives: First, it safeguards transgender individuals fleeing states such as Texas, Tennessee, and Florida &#8212; where enforcement of anti-trans laws beyond state borders has been demonstrated &#8212; by preventing these states from executing warrants within Minnesota. Second, and more significantly in relation to child custody, the bill grants Minnesota jurisdiction over custody disputes in cases where one parent seeks to relocate a transgender child to a state that would prohibit their medication, or when a parent intends to move the child for the purpose of detransitioning them.</p><p>See the particular provision here:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe41a1f84-fab5-41c2-aaa4-f2a03ecf2f9a_1432x1172.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe41a1f84-fab5-41c2-aaa4-f2a03ecf2f9a_1432x1172.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe41a1f84-fab5-41c2-aaa4-f2a03ecf2f9a_1432x1172.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe41a1f84-fab5-41c2-aaa4-f2a03ecf2f9a_1432x1172.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe41a1f84-fab5-41c2-aaa4-f2a03ecf2f9a_1432x1172.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe41a1f84-fab5-41c2-aaa4-f2a03ecf2f9a_1432x1172.png" width="1432" height="1172" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e41a1f84-fab5-41c2-aaa4-f2a03ecf2f9a_1432x1172.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1172,&quot;width&quot;:1432,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:599812,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe41a1f84-fab5-41c2-aaa4-f2a03ecf2f9a_1432x1172.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe41a1f84-fab5-41c2-aaa4-f2a03ecf2f9a_1432x1172.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe41a1f84-fab5-41c2-aaa4-f2a03ecf2f9a_1432x1172.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe41a1f84-fab5-41c2-aaa4-f2a03ecf2f9a_1432x1172.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Section of the Trans Refuge Act that applies to child custody</figcaption></figure></div><p>It is important to note that these provisions <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/518D">amend 518D</a>, also known as the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, which relates to child custody disputes <em>between parents or guardians </em>across state lines. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Child_Custody_Jurisdiction_and_Enforcement_Act">UCCJEA</a> is a uniform act adopted between states to deal with custody disputes between parents across state lines. These provisions are not intended to allow the state to take possession of trans kids from parents who are residents of the state who do not affirm their gender. Rather, all the provisions do is allow a judge in the state to have jurisdiction over a custody dispute <em>between parents</em> when one parent is affirming their trans kid and the other is not and the custody battle stretches over state lines.</p><p>One major reason that this is necessary is that with 13 states banning gender affirming care, non-affirming parents in custody disputes may attempt to take their kids to states that would allow them to do so with no recourse for the other parent. Already, we have seen state laws proposed and advanced in places like Florida that would allow a non-custodial parent to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/florida-anti-trans-bill-court-custody-kids-gender-affirming-care-2023-3">essentially kidnap</a> their trans kid from a custodial parent in another state. The Minnesota law would make it so that a judge could intervene if such an action took place. Ultimately, the bill has nothing to do with &#8220;taking kids from parents in the state who don&#8217;t affirm their genders.&#8221; Rather, all it does is allow a judge to hear a case between parents of trans kids who reside in different states.</p><p>Misinformation about the taking trans kids from non-affirming parents seems to be increasingly common, even though there are no laws proposed or passed in the United States that would do that. Transgender youth need protections more than ever in a country where so many states target every aspect of their lives. Because we know that gender affirming care can save the lives of trans youth, it is important that affirming parents at least get a fair shot in court. The Minnesota Trans Refuge Bill will allow that to happen.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.erininthemorning.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Please support my independent reporting and activism on transgender legislation by subscribing.

Zooey Zephyr, the first transgender woman elected to Montana's legislature, attended a Montana House of Representatives session to oppose an anti-transgender bill that would remove references to transgender individuals from more than 40 sections of state code. The bill, which would define sex in a way that excludes trans people, was one of over a dozen heard this year. The previous day, her strong speech against the gender affirming care ban the state had passed led to the Montana Freedom Caucus calling for her censure while intentionally and repeatedly misgendering her. When she punched in, they refused to recognize her to speak, and instead moved forward to pass the bill. </p><p>Tensions flared on the House Floor when the entire Democratic Caucus rose to demand that she be permitted to speak. In a strikingly undemocratic move, Republican House Speaker Regier declined to allow it, asserting that he could refuse to allow anyone to speak at his discretion. When Minority Leader Abbott objected, they moved to a packed rules committee meeting, which upheld the ruling. Following that, the Speaker stated it was his intent to no longer allow Representative Zephyr to speak moving forward.</p><p>You can watch how it unfolded here:</p><div id="youtube2-g_1y4pxHrio" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;g_1y4pxHrio&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/g_1y4pxHrio?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.erininthemorning.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Please support my independent reporting and activism on transgender legislation by subscribing.

Indeed for the rest of the day, Rep. Zephyr punched in on multiple occasions to speak and was refused recognition each time. Speaker Regier has demanded an &#8220;apology&#8221; as a first step for when she accurately and pointedly stated that the people who vote for a bill that would forcibly detransition trans youth would have &#8220;blood on their hands.&#8221; </p><p>Gender affirming care saves lives, and Rep. Zephyr passionately argued that on debate for Senate Bill 99 the day before. It has been shown to reduce suicide rates of transgender youth by <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2789423">up to 73%</a> in the latest Journal of the American Medical Association article on the topic. Transgender people know the trauma that lack of access to care causes. That trauma is further compounded when you remove the care from people already receiving it.</p><p>Speaking to the <a href="https://montanafreepress.org/2023/04/20/house-speaker-matt-regier-refuses-to-recognize-rep-zooey-zephyr-on-floor-until-she-apologizes/">Montana Free Press</a>, she spoke about the profoundly detrimental impact these bills have on trans people in the state:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;I have lost friends to suicide this year,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I field the calls from multiple families who dealt with suicide attempts, with trans youth who have fled the state, people who have been attacked on the side of the road, because of legislation like this. I spoke with clarity and precision about the harm these bills do. And they say they want an apology, but what they really want is silence as they take away the rights of trans and queer Montanans.&#8221;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>There have been undemocratic moves to silence minority legislators all over the United States in recent months. This is not the first time a transgender representative has been silenced. Just a month ago, Representative Mauree Turner, the state&#8217;s first nonbinary representative, <a href="https://19thnews.org/2023/03/oklahoma-censures-nonbinary-lawmaker-mauree-turner/">was censured</a> for their own protests against anti-trans bills in the state. Just two weeks ago, two lawmakers <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/04/06/1168363992/tennessee-expel-3-democrats-house-vote">were expelled</a> in Tennessee for a demonstration on the House Floor. The GOP has shown an increased willingness to silence all criticism in states where they maintain a supermajority.</p><p>Representative Zooey Zephyr <a href="https://twitter.com/ZoAndBehold/status/1649267029722157056?s=20">released a statement </a>of her intent moving forward. She says that she will continue to advocate for her community and her constituents, and that &#8220;no amount of silencing tactics will prevent her from doing that.&#8221;</p><p>Read her statement here:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff74f888-3c62-4842-9b96-de08dcd35d25_1603x1832.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff74f888-3c62-4842-9b96-de08dcd35d25_1603x1832.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff74f888-3c62-4842-9b96-de08dcd35d25_1603x1832.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff74f888-3c62-4842-9b96-de08dcd35d25_1603x1832.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff74f888-3c62-4842-9b96-de08dcd35d25_1603x1832.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff74f888-3c62-4842-9b96-de08dcd35d25_1603x1832.jpeg" width="1456" height="1664" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ff74f888-3c62-4842-9b96-de08dcd35d25_1603x1832.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1664,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Image&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Image" title="Image" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff74f888-3c62-4842-9b96-de08dcd35d25_1603x1832.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff74f888-3c62-4842-9b96-de08dcd35d25_1603x1832.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff74f888-3c62-4842-9b96-de08dcd35d25_1603x1832.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff74f888-3c62-4842-9b96-de08dcd35d25_1603x1832.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><a href="https://twitter.com/ZoAndBehold/status/1649267029722157056/photo/1">Statement from Representative Zooey Zephyr</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Rep. Zephyr received an outpouring of support from leaders and communities around the United States. The Montana American Indian Caucus, a bipartisan group, <a href="https://twitter.com/NoraMabie/status/1649178923941412865?s=20">released a statement</a> supporting her following the cutting off of American Indian Representative Stewart Peregoy for calling the move fascist. The <a href="https://twitter.com/MTDems/status/1649238576998273024?s=20">Montana Democratic Party</a> has likewise released a statement in support. Lawmakers around the United States shared her statement, such as <a href="https://twitter.com/VoteGloriaJ?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Rep. Gloria Johnson </a>of the Tennessee Three and <a href="https://twitter.com/MalloryMcMorrow/status/1649403540018790404?s=20">Senator Mallory McMorrow</a> of Michigan. These are just a handful of hundreds of elected officials and organizations that have rallied to her support.</p><p>Moving forward, we will see if Republican legislators continue to support their speaker in not allowing Rep. Zephyr to speak. If they do, the move is likely to be met with fierce resistance from the local community. Increasingly, her story is getting coverage in prominent sections of major media outlets such as the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/transgender-lawmaker-silenced-montana-censure-ee3e30ee6a1cd7c0faa8fd072d580a94">Associated Press</a> and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/20/us/politics/montana-zooey-zephyr-transgender-bill.html">New York Times</a>.

This set of guidelines, reminiscent of targeted restrictions on abortion providers also known as TRAP laws, makes most care in the state impossible to administer. As a result, doctors that provide gender affirming care statewide have had to pull their trans patients off of their medication, forcing them to medically detransition. The Missouri order is one of the cruelest in the country, and is part of a new wave of laws that target adult care.</p><p>The Missouri ban outlines numerous stipulations for clinics offering care, effectively making it illegal or too legally precarious to provide such services. One particularly troublesome requirement mandates that transgender individuals must have depression and anxiety resolved prior to receiving gender-affirming care. Coupled with another condition stating that dysphoria must be "intense," clinics that successfully address depression and anxiety to comply with the first stipulation may then be informed that their patients' dysphoria was not "intense" enough. This creates a clear Catch-22, particularly since gender-affirming care often alleviates depression and anxiety on its own. </p><p>See the regulations:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75ef275a-832b-4fbc-900e-bbbd94125408_678x682.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75ef275a-832b-4fbc-900e-bbbd94125408_678x682.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75ef275a-832b-4fbc-900e-bbbd94125408_678x682.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75ef275a-832b-4fbc-900e-bbbd94125408_678x682.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75ef275a-832b-4fbc-900e-bbbd94125408_678x682.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75ef275a-832b-4fbc-900e-bbbd94125408_678x682.png" width="678" height="682" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/75ef275a-832b-4fbc-900e-bbbd94125408_678x682.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:682,&quot;width&quot;:678,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:256970,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75ef275a-832b-4fbc-900e-bbbd94125408_678x682.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75ef275a-832b-4fbc-900e-bbbd94125408_678x682.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75ef275a-832b-4fbc-900e-bbbd94125408_678x682.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75ef275a-832b-4fbc-900e-bbbd94125408_678x682.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Regulations from Missouri AG order</figcaption></figure></div><p>For transgender adults already receiving care, a questionable "grandfather" clause purportedly allows them to continue treatment. However, in practice, this is not the case. Clinics must still retroactively adhere to all other regulations, even for transgender adults who have been grandfathered into their care. Compliance with some of these regulations is unattainable, such as evaluating "transgender social contagion," an unproven pseudoscientific concept that clinics have no means to assess.</p><p>Additionally, the mandate requires clinics to maintain 15-year follow-up records, distribute misleading informational pamphlets, ensure that patients are evaluated by a psychologist for unspecified developmental psychology concerns, and maintain extensive paperwork detailing compliance with these regulations. Ultimately, the directive imposes sudden and strict infrastructure requirements, similar to Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers (TRAP) laws used to close abortion clinics. As a result, transgender individuals' access to medication is effectively restricted or eliminated at all levels.</p><p>As weeks have gone by, stories have come out of Missouri describing the effect this is having on local transgender care. A<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@noodle.milo/video/7222101741343362350?lang=en"> video posted to TikTok</a> went viral where an adult transgender individual named Milo emotionally detailed the devastating effects of the Missouri General&#8217;s actions: </p><blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m scared and I don&#8217;t know what to do. Testosterone has been lifesaving for me. Taking me off of testosterone right now is taking away my happiness. It&#8217;s taking away my healthcare. I&#8217;m a legal adult, I can make my own decisions. I don&#8217;t know for sure, because I haven&#8217;t been able to get in contact with my provider, but it looks like I will have to detransition for the time being&#8230; and I don&#8217;t know what to do, I don&#8217;t know what to think.

The day after the directive, numerous transgender patients received a letter from a clinic stating that compliance with the new Missouri regulation in time to distribute medication was unattainable. Consequently, the clinic, like several others, had to examine the rules, guard against opportunistic inquiries by the Attorney General, and assess their ability to ever comply with the regulation. This led to the cancellation of appointments for transgender patients. </p><p>Harvard Clinical Instructor Alejandra Caraballo <a href="https://twitter.com/Esqueer_/status/1649047870702534656?s=20">stated of the regulations</a>, &#8220;This policy effectively bans all gender affirming care by creating a kafkaesque set of regulations no one can meet.&#8221;</p><p>See <a href="https://twitter.com/EliErlick/status/1646944532733239298/photo/1">the letter</a>:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fedc46007-868e-4e51-9627-e7c864b0f086_1000x700.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fedc46007-868e-4e51-9627-e7c864b0f086_1000x700.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fedc46007-868e-4e51-9627-e7c864b0f086_1000x700.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fedc46007-868e-4e51-9627-e7c864b0f086_1000x700.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fedc46007-868e-4e51-9627-e7c864b0f086_1000x700.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fedc46007-868e-4e51-9627-e7c864b0f086_1000x700.jpeg" width="1000" height="700" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/edc46007-868e-4e51-9627-e7c864b0f086_1000x700.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:700,&quot;width&quot;:1000,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Image&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Image" title="Image" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fedc46007-868e-4e51-9627-e7c864b0f086_1000x700.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fedc46007-868e-4e51-9627-e7c864b0f086_1000x700.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fedc46007-868e-4e51-9627-e7c864b0f086_1000x700.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fedc46007-868e-4e51-9627-e7c864b0f086_1000x700.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Gender affirming care saves lives. Many studies have found the positive impact of this care on transgender people obtaining it, such as a study that showed a<a href="https://www.hcplive.com/view/suicide-risk-reduces-73-transgender-nonbinary-youths-gender-affirming-care"> 73% reduction in suicidality</a> or another that showed a <a href="https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(21)00568-1/fulltext">40% reduction</a> in recent suicide attempts. Over 50 studies have showed the benefits of gender affirming care, and these studies <a href="https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-well-being-of-transgender-people/">have been compiled</a> by the Cornell University Center for the Study of Inequality. Policies like this not only deny the care, it traumatizes transgender people by pulling them off of the care.</p><p>These laws that are targeting gender affirming care providers in Missouri are similar to TRAP laws used to target abortion providers. Trap laws are defined by <a href="https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/issues/abortion/types-attacks/trap-laws">Planned Parenthood</a> as costly, severe, and medically unnecessary requirements imposed on abortion providers to shut down clinics and make access more difficult. TRAP laws that are commonly seen involve reporting requirements, overly burdensome compliance standards, counseling requirements, and mandatory disinformation documents. All of these are being recycled and used in the Missouri ban.</p><p>The Attorney General&#8217;s regulations officially go into effect on April 27th. <a href="https://www.ksdk.com/article/life/wellness/planned-parenthood-central-west-end-st-louis/63-9d6be75f-d712-4677-95c5-a272461a98a5">Pop-up clinics</a> have emerged across the state to try to get transgender people access to the medication before the hard cut-off time. If the policies take effect, they will have a devastating impact on the trans community in Missouri. Lambda Legal is <a href="https://twitter.com/aclu_mo/status/1646626330090393602?s=20">currently recruiting</a> people affected in order to challenge the policy in court.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.erininthemorning.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Please support my independent reporting and activism on transgender legislation by subscribing.

Zooey Zephyr delivered a powerful speech against anti-trans legislation in Montana. She spoke vehemently against Senate Bill 99, which would force youth to medically detransition, emphasizing the suffering it would inflict. In her closing remarks, Zephyr shamed lawmakers for even considering the damaging legislation. In response, the majority leader asserted that the body "would not be shamed." Rep. Zephyr answered sharply, "Then I hope the next time there's an invocation and you bow your head in prayer, you see the blood on your hands."</p><p>Later that evening, Republicans who belong to the Montana Freedom Caucus, a far-right group of legislators, released a letter calling for her resignation. They released <a href="https://twitter.com/MTFreedomCaucus/status/1648486168122757130">the letter on twitter</a> and misgendered her several times in both the tweet and the letter itself. </p><p>Advocates for transgender rights condemned the letter. Organizations like the Human Rights Campaign, PFLAG, and The LGBTQ+ Victory Fund rallied to Rep. Zephyr&#8217;s side. PFLAG tweeted in response, &#8220;Misgendering her as you call for decorum? Do. Better.&#8221; </p><p>Here is the speech that scared the Freedom Caucus in Montana so much that they felt the need to call for censure:</p><div id="youtube2-1XjF_ReXEXs" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;1XjF_ReXEXs&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:&quot;2s&quot;,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1XjF_ReXEXs?start=2s&amp;rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>Calls among the far right grew to censure her. Charlie Kirk, who was quoted as saying he wanted trans people to be dealt with &#8220;the way we dealt with it in the 50s and 60s,&#8221; a clear call for lynching, replied in the <a href="https://twitter.com/charliekirk11/status/1648760282536382464?s=20">Freedom Caucus&#8217; support</a>. Fox News <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trans-montana-lawmaker-lashes-gop-colleagues-house-floor-debate-blood-hands">released a story</a> with a fiery headline. Even Montana&#8217;s congressperson representing Montana&#8217;s 2nd district, Representative Matt Rosendale, came in support of the <a href="https://twitter.com/MattForMontana/status/1648739455702794287?s=20">Freedom Caucus.</a></p><p>In response, Representative Zephyr released a statement where she does not back down and instead declares that she will never stop fighting for transgender youth. In it, she closes off with the signature line, &#8220;With Pride and Determination.&#8221;</p><p>Here is her full letter:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6fd832a-13d7-436f-b9bc-6b086e3f4dc4_1487x1830.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6fd832a-13d7-436f-b9bc-6b086e3f4dc4_1487x1830.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6fd832a-13d7-436f-b9bc-6b086e3f4dc4_1487x1830.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6fd832a-13d7-436f-b9bc-6b086e3f4dc4_1487x1830.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6fd832a-13d7-436f-b9bc-6b086e3f4dc4_1487x1830.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6fd832a-13d7-436f-b9bc-6b086e3f4dc4_1487x1830.jpeg" width="1456" height="1792" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d6fd832a-13d7-436f-b9bc-6b086e3f4dc4_1487x1830.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1792,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Image&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Image" title="Image" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6fd832a-13d7-436f-b9bc-6b086e3f4dc4_1487x1830.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6fd832a-13d7-436f-b9bc-6b086e3f4dc4_1487x1830.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6fd832a-13d7-436f-b9bc-6b086e3f4dc4_1487x1830.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6fd832a-13d7-436f-b9bc-6b086e3f4dc4_1487x1830.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><blockquote><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p><p>Wednesday, April 19, 2023</p><p><strong>Representative Zooey Zephyr's Response to the Call for Censure and Continued Commitment to Advocating for Transgender Rights</strong></p><p>HELENA, MT - In response to the Montana Freedom Caucus' call for my censure, I stand by my accurate description of the devastating consequences of banning essential medical care for transgender youth. The recently passed Senate Bill 99 is a part of an alarming trend of anti-trans legislation in our state, which includes over a dozen unconstitutional bills. These bills ban our art forms, our stories, our healthcare, and our very existence in Montana code. Policy by policy, republicans are legislating the eradication of queer and transgender people from public life.</p><p>During the debate on Governor Gianforte&#8217;s amendments to Senate Bill 99, I made the following statement: "If you are [denying gender-affirming care and] forcing a trans child to go through puberty, that is tantamount to torture, and this body should be ashamed.&#8221; After Majority Leader Sue Vinton interjected to say that the Republican party &#8220;would not be shamed,&#8221; I closed my speech by saying, &#8220;Then the only thing I will say is if you vote yes on this bill, I hope the next time there&#8217;s an invocation, when you bow your heads in prayer, you see the blood on your hands."</p><p>I recently shared <a href="https://twitter.com/ZoAndBehold/status/1648466954011959300?s=20">a letter</a> from an emergency room physician highlighting the life-threatening impact these bills have on our transgender youth. The physician recounted the story of a young transgender patient who attempted suicide, stating "My state doesn't want me." This is a stark reminder of the real-world consequences of these hateful and harmful bills.</p><p>It is disheartening that the Montana Freedom Caucus would stoop so low as to misgender me in their letter, further demonstrating their disregard for the dignity and humanity of transgender individuals. Their call for &#8220;civility and respect&#8221; is hypocritical given their actions.</p><p>As Montana grapples with critical issues like healthcare, education, and our state&#8217;s housing crisis, it's disappointing that some legislators prioritize targeting the trans community over addressing these concerns. Our resources should be aimed at fostering a safe, inclusive, and prosperous environment for all Montanans, regardless of their identity.</p><p>Ultimately, I am unconcerned with the Montana Freedom Caucus&#8217; call to censure me. I stood on the floor to speak on behalf of my community, and as long as I am a member of the Montana Legislature, I will never stop fighting for trans people in our state. These actions only strengthen my commitment to promoting equality and justice for all Montanans.</p><p>With Pride and Determination&#8212;</p><p>Representative Zooey Zephyr</p><p>Montana&#8217;s 100th District</p></blockquote><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.erininthemorning.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Please support my independent reporting and activism on transgender legislation by subscribing.

Zephyr had enough and shamed the body for their attacks on trans people.</p><p>The bill being heard on the floor was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/transgender-healthcare-ban-minors-montana-049eb8f098ce297b52ce2973839ad1f4">Senate Bill 99</a>, a ban that will force transgender youth in the state of Montana off of their medication, leading to their forced detransition. The bill had already passed both chambers in recent weeks, but the governor used an amendment veto because the way in which the bill defined sex did not cover all intended scenarios around the ban. If representatives concurred with the governors amendments, the bill would go on to pass and transgender youth in the state would be forced off of their medication.</p><p>That&#8217;s when she stood and condemned the body, saying that the house should be ashamed to even consider the bill. When Majority Leader Sue Vinton stood to interrupt her, she retorted, &#8220;If you vote yes on this bill, and you vote yes on this amendment, I hope the next time there&#8217;s an invocation and you bow your head in prayer, you see the blood on your hands.&#8221;</p><p>See the exchange:</p><div id="youtube2-1XjF_ReXEXs" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;1XjF_ReXEXs&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1XjF_ReXEXs?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.erininthemorning.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Please support my independent reporting and activism on transgender legislation by subscribing.

Earlier in committee hearings, representatives from every major Montana medical organization <a href="https://erininthemorn.substack.com/p/montana-senator-did-not-even-read">spoke out</a> against the bill, saying it will result in dead trans youth by way of suicide. </p><p>At least one physician in a local emergency department <a href="https://twitter.com/ZoAndBehold/status/1648466954011959300?s=20">reported a suicide attempt </a>over these bills :</p><blockquote><p>I am writing to share an experience from my work that is relevant to the work you are doing in Helena. I work as an emergency medicine physician, and during a shift this week a partner of mine came to share his distress about a young suicidal teen he was caring for. He had asked the teen what their biggest stressors were, and at the top of the list the teen, who happened to be transgender, referenced the current legislative session and told my partner, &#8220;My state doesn&#8217;t want me.&#8221; Please consider that statement and let it sink in. This young teen is so distressed by the laws that you all have been discussing and passing, that they were driven to want to kill themselves.</p></blockquote><p>The full letter is presented here, as reported to Rep.

We have already seen countless testimony in several state hearings across the country of medical experts affirming this. The studies affirm it as well. One study showed a <a href="https://www.hcplive.com/view/suicide-risk-reduces-73-transgender-nonbinary-youths-gender-affirming-care">73% lower suicide rate</a> for people who were allowed gender affirming care. Another showed a<a href="https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(21)00568-1/fulltext"> 40% reduction </a>in attempts over the last year. In fact, recently, The Center for the Study of Inequality at Cornell University <a href="https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-well-being-of-transgender-people/">compiled 51 studies</a> showing improved mental and physical outcomes for those allowed to transition. </p><p>On this same day, Montana's legislature considered several other anti-trans bills, demonstrating the state's regressive stance on transgender issues. One such bill, HB458, aims to effectively erase transgender individuals from the legal landscape, prohibiting changes to gender markers on vital documents like birth certificates, death certificates, and driver's licenses. Meanwhile, SB518 seeks to allow teachers to misgender trans students if a parent objects to their gender identity - but offers no protection for correctly gendering students should a parent demand respect for their child's identity. Another proposed bill seeks to amend an anti-porn act, barring "acts of transgenderism" from any platform without age-verification, essentially instituting a statewide blackout on transgender visibility.</p><p>See the provisions of <em>that</em> act here:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7785ac55-6746-4c83-ac8f-15d50f578f48_1595x1070.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7785ac55-6746-4c83-ac8f-15d50f578f48_1595x1070.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7785ac55-6746-4c83-ac8f-15d50f578f48_1595x1070.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7785ac55-6746-4c83-ac8f-15d50f578f48_1595x1070.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7785ac55-6746-4c83-ac8f-15d50f578f48_1595x1070.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7785ac55-6746-4c83-ac8f-15d50f578f48_1595x1070.jpeg" width="1456" height="977" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7785ac55-6746-4c83-ac8f-15d50f578f48_1595x1070.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:977,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Image&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Image" title="Image" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7785ac55-6746-4c83-ac8f-15d50f578f48_1595x1070.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7785ac55-6746-4c83-ac8f-15d50f578f48_1595x1070.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7785ac55-6746-4c83-ac8f-15d50f578f48_1595x1070.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7785ac55-6746-4c83-ac8f-15d50f578f48_1595x1070.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><a href="https://twitter.com/ZoAndBehold/status/1648376317539401728?s=20">Provisions from a newly released amendment to an anti-porn bill.</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Senate Bill 99 bill did go on to pass the Montana legislature.

This legislation, unprecedented in any state, signifies a significant advancement for transgender minors' rights and those pursuing abortions. Previously, transgender runaway youths faced sleeping outdoors or engaging in perilous living situations because licensed shelters had to report them to their parents. If enacted, this bill would allow these youths to enter shelters and host homes without fear of being reported to their parents, preventing forced detransition or maintaining an unwanted pregnancy.</p><p>Senate bill 5599 primarily deals with how the state should handle runaway youth that end up in licensed shelters, host home programs, and group-care facilities. Transgender youth have extremely high rates of homelessness. In a recent <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Trevor-Project-Homelessness-Report.pdf">Trevor project report</a>, 28% of LGBTQ+ youth report homelessness at some point in their lives. 16% of LGBTQ+ youth have run away from home, with half of them reporting that they ran away because of mistreatment due to their LGBTQ+ identity. That number is even higher for transgender youth: 38% of transgender youth report homelessness and housing instability. </p><p>Under current law in Washington, if these youth end up in a shelter, the shelter has to report them to their parents. Only if there is active abuse or neglect could the state determine not to do so. Senate Bill 5599 adds an exception to the parental notification requirement: whenever youth have obtained or are attempting to obtain gender affirming care or abortion services. </p><p>See the following provisions in the bill:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F576ca850-1bd1-4fd2-abb5-1bdcb1d44349_569x332.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F576ca850-1bd1-4fd2-abb5-1bdcb1d44349_569x332.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F576ca850-1bd1-4fd2-abb5-1bdcb1d44349_569x332.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F576ca850-1bd1-4fd2-abb5-1bdcb1d44349_569x332.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F576ca850-1bd1-4fd2-abb5-1bdcb1d44349_569x332.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F576ca850-1bd1-4fd2-abb5-1bdcb1d44349_569x332.png" width="727" height="424.18980667838315" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/576ca850-1bd1-4fd2-abb5-1bdcb1d44349_569x332.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:332,&quot;width&quot;:569,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:727,&quot;bytes&quot;:61335,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F576ca850-1bd1-4fd2-abb5-1bdcb1d44349_569x332.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F576ca850-1bd1-4fd2-abb5-1bdcb1d44349_569x332.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F576ca850-1bd1-4fd2-abb5-1bdcb1d44349_569x332.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F576ca850-1bd1-4fd2-abb5-1bdcb1d44349_569x332.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Provisions in SB5599 that would protect trans kids or those seeking abortions from being reported.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Unsurprisingly, right-wing figures erupted, claiming that the bill allows the state to &#8220;take kids from parents who don&#8217;t affirm their gender.&#8221; Caitlyn Jenner<a href="https://twitter.com/Caitlyn_Jenner/status/1647427538530992130"> called it</a> &#8220;an absolute disgrace.&#8221; </p><p>Donald Trump Junior <a href="https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1647377958028427264">tweeted</a> of the bill, &#8220;These sick bastards are evil. WTF happened to &#8220;reasonable&#8221; or &#8220;moderate&#8221; democrats? Washington passes bill allowing the state to TAKE CHILDREN AWAY FROM PARENTS that do not consent to their child's gender transition surgeries...&#8221;</p><p>These claims are not born out of the facts though. The bill does not change anything about child custody law or modify existing child abuse statutes. It does not allow the state to come into a home and take away transgender kids from non-affirming parents. It also does not change the state&#8217;s <a href="https://wafp.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Youth-consent-article-with-case-studies.pdf">existing mature minor law</a>, which allows some youth to consent to gender affirming care and abortion services under 18 already. Instead, it allows trans youth who have already run away to seek shelter rather than sleep on the streets without being reported to parents. Given the aforementioned very high homelessness rates of trans youth runaways, this is a compassionate decision that will give them shelter.</p><p>It also will protect against forced detransition and abuse. The majority of LGBTQ+ youth who run away from home report that they did so because of mistreatment or fear of mistreatment. Transgender youth immediately reported and returned to such parents might then be withdrawn from medication and forced to detransition, an incredibly traumatic process for these youth. Instead, this bill allows these youth to seek care without fear that they will be turned in or forced off of that care. </p><p>With so much of the country moving to forcibly detransition all trans youth in the state, Washington is breaking from that and taking a different path. Last week, the state <a href="https://erininthemorn.substack.com/p/washington-becomes-10th-state-to">passed legislation</a> shielding abortion and gender-affirming care refugees from other states against investigation and extradition. The state is now poised to enact one of the most substantial protections for transgender youth in the U.S. The amended bill must return to the Senate for final passage, but if approved, it could serve as a model for other states seeking to enhance protections for transgender individuals.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.erininthemorning.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Please support my independent reporting and activism on transgender legislation by subscribing.
